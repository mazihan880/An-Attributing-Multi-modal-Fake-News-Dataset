In the summer if you switch your ceiling fan to rotate counterclockwise, the blades should point up allowing air to move down and creating a cool breeze underneath the fan. In the winter your ceiling fan needs to rotate clockwise, the blades will point down allowing the fan to push warm air down towards the floor. Ceiling fans use less electricity than running the air conditioner or furnace, which will allow you to adjust your thermostat a few degrees.

I theorized I had strep and possibly the flu due to my symptoms.  Check-in from the car, I was first. Jamie, states how are you first and I called before you? I state, it's probably because I'm black Jamie..pipe down! By now, I am expecting strep and flu swabs. The provider walks to my side of the car looks in my ears and I have an infection. Next, comes a lady with a swab. Jamie and I watch tensely. She states, we gonna check you for Covid. I state, woah! I do not believe I have Covid. She says it's standard procedure. I say...if I must. Jamie watches, muttering glad I am not first. I consider a swift throat punch, but no time...this lady is coming in hot with a swab! As she enters my nasal cavity, I ponder why the other tests weren't a consideration? As she plunges towards my gray matter, I resist the urge to throat punch her (as she tells me to relax). As she continues to my CSF, I shed a tear and pondered who in the heck would do this modern day torture multiple times a week? They are a boss! I also consider I may need to perform a halo test when I get home. Jamie looks over at me and says, hell naw I aint doing it! Lol...but he does! I would later test negative, but was definitely a rough time...I was so thankful of how blessed we are to have jobs that we do not have to apologize to for being sick. It was a blessing to be able to take care of one another.  As for Jamie...that's his story to tell....but he is recovering nicely. I'll be developing new material soon...#issastruggle #thereasonwebeenMIA #onemoreweekhomeandIwouldhavegoneallshinning #heresJohnny #nohyperboleshetouchedCSF #nurse #funny #stories",

I\u2019ve been going through a massive life shift for quite a few years now, three parts act of God, two parts act of Me, that makes full fathom five; but I feel I\u2019m finally past the acute, hemorrhage-pain in the ER and into the healing physical therapy. The ocean helps. In Aotearoa New Zealand, especially my year alone with Ash, she healed me daily. She called us in. She calmed me. She told me to wait. She held me, and my kid. Here on Cape Cod, she reminds. \nYou can\u2019t help but notice that, here. There is a bigger story, a more important story. The story will always wash up on the shore, like a bottle from the lighthouse keeper. You wait. You lose patience. \nI\u2019ve been thinking about intergenerational trauma this week, as I hang with families, catch up with old friends, enfold myself in the bigger. The stories that families keep in locked boxes, the expense of secrecy, the deep shame around addiction, the normalizing of so many things that get handed down over, and over, and over. Water on rocks over time. The lengths a family will go to in order to hide something bad. A whole organism that forms around a secret. \nThe hermit crabs are everywhere around our feet. I love them best of all, my comrades, always searching for a home, never settled by design. Ash picks them up with delight. We found one the other day hanging out in a living periwinkle. We called it an illegal sublet. \nThe sea. The dance between this country\u2019s dark history and our current quagmire. The dance between ego, ambition, fame, trauma and, eventually, love. The dance I did with the world. The dance Ash will do with the world. \nThe thing a child needs most. Needed most. Loving arms. Safety. Reassurance. Protection from the dark, exposure to the sun, an invitation into the bigger, more important story.\nA sense of belonging. Isn\u2019t that all we ever wanted, as children?\nWaving to all of you, with love.\n(Photos by me, Grandma, Brendon, Alex).",

The fish was beautifully photographed by Simon\u2019s girlfriend and fully deserved a weekly Drennan Cup award.  As far as we know, it is the biggest barbel to have been landed on a Drennan Series 7 rod \u2013 in this case the ultra-popular Specialist Avon Quiver 12ft 1\u00bdlb.\nSimon has been fishing a campaign on an undisclosed river, taking a series of specimen fish including Carp, Roach & Perch \u2013 plus a handful of quality barbel, culminating in this staggering fish.  Simon, a 27-year old carpenter, fished a size 10 hook to a Kryston Mantis hooklength on a helicopter set up and 15lb mainline. \n\u201cI awoke in the early hours to a screamer of a take, I thought it must be something that had gone through my lines again, but the run just continued as I ran to the rod. It then became obvious that a fish was responsible. The fight was powerful, juddery at times.  When the fish was ready for the net I could see it was a big fish but under low light and in driving rain it was hard to see just how big.  It wasn\u2019t until I lifted the net out to carry it to the mat that I realised how heavy she was. I thought, I\u2019ve got something special here!\u201d  Simon recalled.\nWe\u2019re looking forward to hearing how Simon gets on for the rest of the season, especially in February / March time when Barbel often tend to be at their peak weight\u2026.\nFor further details on the Drennan Series 7 Avon Quiver click here:\nhttp://www.drennantackle.com/productDetail.php...",

    "content": "A. G. Gaston was born on July 4, 1892 in a log cabin in Demopolis, Alabama.  The grandson of an enslaved Afrikan, Gaston's parents were Tom and Rosa McDonald Gaston; however, he grew up in the home of his grandparents, Joe and Idella Gaston. He moved to Birmingham in 1905 with the Loveman family, who employed his mother as a cook.\nAlthough he had aspired to attend Tuskegee Institute, Gaston\u2019s formal education ended with the 10th grade. After earning his certificate from Tuggle (which only went through the 10th grade. He served in the army in France during World War I, then went to work in the mines run by Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company in Fairfield, Alabama.\nBusiness growth\nWhile working in the mines, he hit on the plan of selling lunches to his fellow miners and then branched into loaning money to them at twenty-five percent interest. It was also while working in the mines that he conceived of the idea of offering burial insurance to co-workers. He had noticed that mine widows would come to the mines and to local churches to collect donations in order to bury their husbands and he wondered if people would \"give a few dimes into a burial society to bury their dead\". As a result, Gaston formed the Booker T. Washington Burial Society, which later became the Booker T. Washington Insurance Company.\nDriven out of Fairfield because of his father-in-law's political differences with the mayor, Gaston and his family moved to Birmingham. Gaston bought and renovated a property on the edge of Kelly Ingram Park in downtown Birmingham, where, in partnership with his father-in-law, he started the Smith & Gaston Funeral Home, in 1938. Smith & Gaston sponsored gospel music programs on local radio stations and launched a quartet of its own.\nRealizing that there were not enough African-Americans with sufficient training to be able to work in the insurance and funeral industries, he and his second-wife established a business school.\nOther Gaston enterprises included Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association, the first black-owned financial institution in Birmingham in more than forty years (reportedly established by Gaston when he saw how difficult it was for African-Americans to obtain fair loans from White financial companies) and a motel business (reportedly started because of Gaston's concern that African-Americans traveling through the south during segregation often could not find accommodations). In 1954 Gaston built the A.G. Gaston motel on the site adjoining Kelly Ingram park where the mortuary had once stood.\nPolitics\nWhile his father-in-law had been an active supporter of voting rights and his second wife was a founder of the National Council of Negro Women and an avid advocate for education reform, Gaston himself kept a low political profile through most of the 1940s and 1950s. Although Gaston was reluctant to confront white authorities and the white business establishment directly, Gaston supported the civil rights movement financially. He offered financial support to Autherine Lucy, who had sued to integrate the University of Alabama, and had provided financial assistance to residents of Tuskegee who faced foreclosure because of their role in a boycott of white-owned businesses called to protest their disenfrachisement. When Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a civil rights leader in Birmingham, founded the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights in the wake of the outlawing of the NAACP in the State of Alabama in 1956, the group held its first meeting at Smith & Gaston's offices.\nWhen students at Miles College, a historically black college in Fairfield, attempted to use sit-in and boycott tactics to desegregate downtown Birmingham in 1962, Gaston used his position as a member of the board of trustees of the institution to dissuade them from continuing their campaign while he pursued negotiations with them. Those negotiations produced some token changes, but no significant progress toward desegregating the stores or hiring black employees.\nWhen the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, represented locally by Rev. Shuttlesworth, proposed to support those students' demands in 1963 by widespread demonstrations, challenging both Birmingham's segregation laws and Local Police Commissioner Bull Connor's authority, Gaston opposed the plan and tried to deflect the campaign from public confrontation into negotiations with white business leaders. Gaston tried to talk Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. out of going through with the planned Easter boycott of downtown business and may have bailed him out of jail against his wishes in April, 1963.\nAt the same time, Gaston provided King and Rev. Ralph Abernathy with rooms at his motel at a discount and free meeting rooms at his offices nearby throughout the campaign. He maintained a public show of support for the campaign and not only took part in the meetings with local business leaders, but insisted that Shuttlesworth be brought in since \"he's the man with the marbles\".\nThat unity nearly dissolved, however, after Rev. Abernathy made some comments about unidentified Uncle Toms and Dr. King made a call for unity on April 9, 1963 that made it clear that he would press forward with his plans for confrontation. Gaston issued a press release in response in which he obliquely criticized King by lamenting the lack of communication between white business leaders and \"local colored leadership\".\nThat press release exposed a significant rift between the activists in the movement. Hosea Williams described Gaston as a \"super Uncle Tom\" to the press while complaining that he overcharged for his motel rooms\u2014despite the fact that Williams, and other civil reights leaders were staying at Gatson's motel free of charge. The leaders of the movement were eager, however, to avoid any public airing of those differences; Shuttlesworth soon apologized, SCLC leaders treated the press release as an expression of support for their campaign while Dr. King announced creation of a special committee of local leaders, including Gaston, to meet every morning to approve each day's plans.\nThat committee had no real power, however, as became clear when the movement encouraged school children to march against segregation on May 2, 1963. Gaston protested the strategy, telling King \"Let those kids stay in school. They don't know nothing.\" King replied, \"Brother Gaston, let those people go into the streets where they'll learn something.\" The demonstrations continued.\nViolence\nBecause of his stance as a negotiator, Gaston often faced challenges by proponents from both sides of the civil rights issue.\nOn May 11th, 1963, four people probably associated with the KKK attempted to blow up the part of the A.G. Gaston Motel where King and Abernathy were staying; the home of Martin Luther King's brother Reverend A. D. King was also bombed. Later that night, the bombings sparked riots by African Americans in a twenty-eight-block section of Birmingham. The local police officers and state troopers responded to the crisis and subsequently beat rioters and bystanders. Over fifty people were injured as police were dispatched to clear Kelly Ingram Park.\nUnidentified persons later threw firebombs at Gaston's house, a day after he and his wife had attended a state dinner at the White House with President John F. Kennedy.\nGaston remained disaffected from Dr. King, urging him to stay away, in a statement released in September, 1963, after Dr. King announced plans to return to Birmingham to resume demonstrations. As it turns out, Dr. King did revive the campaign.\nOn the night of January 24, 1976, Gaston and his wife were attacked and beaten by an intruder and Gaston was abducted in his own car; police officers found him two hours later, bound in the back seat of the car.\nLegacy\nGaston published a memoir in 1968, coinciding with the founding of the A. G. Gaston Boys club, which still operates and has expanded to include girls programs.\nGaston famously said, \"I never went into anything with the idea of making money\u2026I thought of doing something, and it would come up and make money. I never thought of trying to get rich\u201d.\nGaston died at age 103 on January 19, 1996. He left behind an insurance company, the Booker T. Washington Insurance Company, a construction firm, the A.G. Gaston Construction Company, and a financial institution, CFS Bancshares. The City of Birmingham owns the motel, which it plans to make into an annex to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, built on the former site of the Booker T. Washington Insurance Company. His net worth was estimated to be more than $130,000,000 at the time of his death.\nFrom the Wikipedia",

    "content": "This pretty much sums up my beliefs of what being a liberal is.\nRon Howard\nJanuary 24 at 5:41 AM\nI'm a liberal, but that doesn't mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let's break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I'm getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same, though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines:\n1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children, disabled, sick, and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.\n2. I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Somehow that's interpreted as \"I believe Obamacare is the end-all, be-all.\" This is not the case. I'm fully aware that the ACA has problems, that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in, and that it's impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws, but I have yet to hear an argument against it that makes \"let people die because they can't afford healthcare\" a better alternative. I believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is, and that everyone should have access to it. And no, I'm not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen.\n3. I believe education should be affordable. It doesn't necessarily have to be free (though it works in other countries so I'm mystified as to why it can't work in the US), but at the end of the day, there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five- or six-figure debt.\n4. I don't believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don't want to work. I have literally never encountered anyone who believes this. Ever. I just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death, freezing to death, or dying because they can't afford to go to the doctor. Fair wages, lower housing costs, universal healthcare, affordable education, and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this. Somehow believing that makes me a communist.\n5. I don't throw around \"I'm willing to pay higher taxes\" lightly. If I'm suggesting something that involves paying more, well, it's because I'm fine with paying my share as long as it's actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while Americans die without healthcare.\n6. I believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent, livable wage. Somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a Mercedes. What it actually means is that no one should have to work three full-time jobs just to keep their head above water. Restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips, multibillion-dollar companies should not have employees on food stamps, workers shouldn't have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet, and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live.\n7. I am not anti-Christian. I have no desire to stop Christians from being Christians, to close churches, to ban the Bible, to forbid prayer in school, etc. (BTW, prayer in school is NOT illegal; *compulsory* prayer in school is - and should be - illegal). All I ask is that Christians recognize *my* right to live according to *my* beliefs. When I get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate Scripture into law, I'm not \"offended by Christianity\" -- I'm offended that you're trying to force me to live by your religion's rules. You know how you get really upset at the thought of Muslims imposing Sharia law on you? That's how I feel about Christians trying to impose biblical law on me. Be a Christian. Do your thing. Just don't force it on me or mine.\n8. I don't believe LGBT people should have more rights than you. I just believe they should have the *same* rights as you.\n9. I don't believe illegal immigrants should come to America and have the world at their feet, especially since THIS ISN'T WHAT THEY DO (spoiler: undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs they're supposed to be abusing, and if they're \"stealing\" your job it's because your employer is hiring illegally). I believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices (i.e., detaining children, splitting up families, ending DACA, etc).\n10. I don't believe the government should regulate everything, but since greed is such a driving force in our country, we NEED regulations to prevent cut corners, environmental destruction, tainted food/water, unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment, etc. It's not that I want the government's hands in everything -- I just don't trust people trying to make money to ensure that their products/practices/etc. are actually SAFE. Is the government devoid of shadiness? Of course not. But with those regulations in place, consumers have recourse if they're harmed and companies are liable for medical bills, environmental cleanup, etc. Just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation.\n11. I believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I can\u2019t get over an election, but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities. Not because any administration I dislike must be Nazis, but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past.\n12. I believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think, and desperately needs to be addressed. Which means those with privilege -- white, straight, male, economic, etc. -- need to start listening, even if you don't like what you're hearing, so we can start dismantling everything that's causing people to be marginalized.\n13. I am not interested in coming after your blessed guns, nor is anyone serving in government. What I am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new, common sense gun regulations. Got another opinion? Put it on your page, not mine.\n14. I believe in so-called political correctness. I prefer to think it\u2019s social politeness. If I call you Chuck and you say you prefer to be called Charles I\u2019ll call you Charles. It\u2019s the polite thing to do. Not because everyone is a delicate snowflake, but because as Maya Angelou put it, when we know better, we do better. When someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurate/less hurtful than the one you're using, you now know better. So why not do better? How does it hurt you to NOT hurt another person?\n15. I believe in funding sustainable energy, including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs. There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry, billionaires. Maybe try investing in something else.\n16. I believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human. They should be paid the same as men who do the same work, should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse. Why on earth shouldn\u2019t they be?\nI think that about covers it. Bottom line is that I'm a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn't mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don't believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved.\nCopy & paste if you want.",

There are approximately one million practicing physicians in the United States, and the United States Navy Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps is holding sealed indictments on about 19,000 of them\u2014general physicians, specialists, surgeons, emergency room, and urgent care staff.\nA JAG source familiar with the indictments told Real Raw News that the indicted doctors took part in an unethical and unlawful partnership with the CDC and NIH during the Covid Plandemic. The CDC/NIH incentivized the offending physicians to coerce patients to get vaxxed even if the patients remonstrated against the potentially lethal jab. Health professionals were encouraged to do everything short of physically striking a patient to win compliance. Tactics included berating the elderly and telling pregnant women that unvaccinated mothers-to-be were jeopardizing the lives of unborn children. The CDC/NIH also encouraged physicians to threaten to \u201cdivorce\u201d patients unwilling to get vaxxed, and to tell patients their names would be added to a \u201crefused vaccination\u201d blacklist. Many patients were denied lifesaving treatments and medications.",

    "content": "Navy SEALs Save Missing Maui Children\nBy M. B. - September 17, 2023\nUnited States Navy SEALs on Thursday found 15 missing Maui children imprisoned in padlocked cages lined with piddle pads at a warehouse near Pier 51 in Honolulu Harbor, but repatriating them with their families has proven problematic, a source in General Eric M. Smith\u2019s office told Real Raw News.\nSince mid-August, the White Hat coalition has skirmished with regime forces while searching for 1,500 children whose parents had not re-enrolled them for school in 2023, even though many attended schools that survived the fires or were distant enough to avoid damage. Our sources believe that FEMA and the regime\u2019s unlawful Joint Task Force 5-0, commanded by Gen. Charles Flynn, murdered many of the missing, evidenced by bodies found in mass graves, but do not believe that Biden\u2019s forces gunned down or took flamethrowers to all 1,500.\nThe federal government and its media allies have refuted claims that children in Maui went missing, saying they either left Hawaii or registered for distance learning due to an emerging strain of Covid.\nOur source said that is an implausible excuse, for U.S. Marines in Lahaina had interviewed credible residents who witnessed federal agents stuffing kids into busses and driving them to destinations unknown.\n\u201cOur people get intel from locals, the \u2018Lahaina Underground,\u2019 residents that didn\u2019t flee and want Governor Green and the cabal ejected from the island. Our purpose is threefold: expel or destroy Biden\u2019s occupying forces, aid relief efforts, find the children,\u201d our source said.\nHe added that Marine reconnaissance platoons in and around Lahaina heard rumors suggesting the feds had ferried or flown kidnapped kids from Maui to Oahu, ostensibly to sell to child slavers or adrenochrome harvesters. The stories were too numerous and craven to dismiss as hearsay, so Marines forwarded the villagers\u2019 detailed accounts up the chain of command to General Smith\u2019s office at Camp Pendleton.\nGeneral Smith was particularly interested in a story that surfaced the previous day, originating from a Lahaina woman claiming to have overheard a conversation in which federal goons and JTF 5-0 personnel discussed a nefarious plan to sneak a dozen children they had hidden in Maui to a safehouse at the Honolulu docks on Oahu. She listened to only a fragment of the conversation before fleeing for fear of being captured or killed.\nOur source said that Gen. Smith contacted his U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command allies, who activated a SEAL team to investigate the terrifying tale. The team\u2019s leader said the frogmen would leave at once for Hawaii but expressed concern that the children might be gone by the time they had eyes on Honolulu Harbor, as the intel would be over a day old. NSWC ordered the SEALs to check piers 39-51, where container ships routinely berthed, and nearby buildings for signs of missing children. An OV-22 Osprey on alert at Marine Corps Base Hawaii would await a request for extraction.\nThe team arrived in Honolulu Thursday night and scoured several shipless piers and structures before abruptly stopping outside a storage building that smelled like ammonia; it held only fish packed in ice. Undeterred, the SEALs continued their rudderless search, finding at 3:00 a.m. a warehouse guarded by three men clad in tactical gear and toting automatic rifles. Cloaked in shadow, the SEALs deployed parabolic microphones and infrared scanners while aiming silenced rifles at their quarry downrange; the guards mumbled amongst one another about their frustration at being paid a pittance to work the graveyard shift, and the infrared guns revealed multiple heat blooms inside the warehouse.\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t tell the number of warm bodies in there, just clusters of temperature gradients. The probability of employees working in a dark warehouse at three in the morning was about zero,\u201d our source said.\nA few SEALs separated into a sniper team and scaled an access ladder to the rooftop of a nearby maintenance building. They set up overwatch while the oblivious sentries ambled about, their faces lit by floodlamps illuminating the fa\u00e7ade. The SEAL commander said he wanted one alive, if possible.\nThe sniper made a silenced shot, and a sentry\u2019s head exploded like a tomato, the deep red of his brainy blood spattering everywhere and his head disappearing.\n\u201cF*** this, let\u2019s get inside,\u201d a different sentry reportedly shouted, but his comrade had bolted across the platform, his boots thudding like hooves, and had run directly into the SEAL commander, who had maneuvered in the darkness as if guided by some inner sonar, sending the location of his prey.\nThe SEAL commander subdued the sentry with a single punch to the kidney.\nThe third guard was struggling to open the warehouse doors when a SEAL\u2019s bullet struck his neck, killing him.\nOnce inside the warehouse, the SEALs saw the unimaginable: sedated children, some covered in their own urine and feces, locked inside cages barely large enough to fit a dog. Not one child made a peep. They silently stared through wire mesh as if in a hypnotic trance. In all, the warehouse held 15 young children imprisoned in filth.\nThe lead SEAL keyed his microphone. \u201cWe need extraction ASAP. It could get hot. Two enemy KIAs, one alive. Fifteen, I repeat 15, kids. All need medical.\u201d\n\u201cAirborne in two minutes,\u201d came the reply.\nThe VTOL Osprey soon hovered at the edge of Pier 51B and lowered its ramp. The SEALs carried the children\u2019s limp bodies and an unconscious prisoner aboard the plane, then instructed the pilots to leave immediately.\nAt Marine Corps Base Hawaii, staff treated the eight boys and seven girls for acute propofol, a potent sedative, intoxication. Bloodwork also showed traces of haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia.\nThe prisoner, identified as Ira Shockey, an employee of Academi, the private security firm formerly known as Blackwater, told interrogators he was hired to guard the exterior and had no idea who or what was inside. He has otherwise refused to answer questions, our source said.\n\u201cWhat kind of people do this? The Deep State is an incubator of evil. It taints what it touches. Now we must find out if these kids\u2019 parents are out there somewhere, or if they\u2019re among the missing, or bodies we\u2019ve unearthed. Macroscopically this seems insignificant\u2014I mean, 15 kids out of 1,500 unaccounted for. We won\u2019t stop until they\u2019re all found or accounted for,\u201d our source said.",

    "content": "Military Tribunal Sentences Sonia Sotomayor to Death\nMarch 10, 2022\nFormer Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor was sentenced to hang by the neck until dead after a military commission at Guantanamo Bay found the Obama-appointee guilty of treason and betraying her oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States.\nOn Monday, March 7, the Deep State Justice had her day in court and found herself answerable to the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps and the Office of Military Commissions. Their offices, with help from the U.S. Marine Corps, helped adjudicate her fate.\nAt GITMO\u2019s south courtroom, Vice Adm. Darse E. Crandall recited the charges against Sotomayor: Treason, aiding and abetting the enemy, crimes against humanity, domestic terrorism, falsifying public records, money laundering, bribery, espionage, and sedition, several of which are punishable via gassing, firing squad, beheading, lethal injection, electrocution, or hanging.  The \u201cWhite Hat\u201d partition has relied on hanging the condemned, with a few exceptions.\nAppearing without counsel, a pugnacious Sotomayor chose to defend herself, saying in an opening statement that she, a Supreme Court Justice with 40 years of legal experience, didn\u2019t need a lawyer to advocate on her behalf. Instead, she told the 3-officer panel that she had absolute and irrevocable immunity from prosecution. Her station as a SCJ, she said, exempted her from being held to account for statements made while on or off the bench, and shielded her against unrighteous and unlawful assaults on her character and work ethic. President Obama, she added boisterously, had promised her protection for life.\nVice Adm. Crandall swiveled his head. \u201cDo you see Obama here? I hope we see him here soon, but he\u2019s not here right now. Maybe you don\u2019t understand where you are. This is a military commission, not your chambers. You have no rights here,\u201d he said.\nHe put her in her place. Her energetic niggling suddenly turned to quiet murmurs of discontent.\nVice Adm. Crandall showed the panel a dozen emails Sotomayor had written to Dr. Anthony Fauci, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, and members of the illegitimate Biden administration on 6 January, two days before she\u2019d blatantly lied at a congressional hearing on Covid-19. There, Sotomayor claimed over 100,000 children were \u201chospitalized in intensive care and dying of Covid,\u201d a statement later refuted by even her most loyal Deep State allies.\nHe went on: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a misspoken mistake, an error. Her emails prove she intended to amplify Covid fear by whimsically manufacturing a number in her head. Do you know how many minors on that date, across the whole country, were actually hospitalized and confirmed as having Covid?\u201d\nHe held up seven fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s right, seven. Seven in all United States. And do you know how many were in critical condition? The answer is none, zero.\u201d\nIn emails to Deep State friends, Sotomayor wrote: \u201cI\u2019ll do everything in my power to ensure the current mandates stay in place. I have authority to enforce belief. The actual number of sick doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that we, the caretakers of the U.S., get everyone on board with mandates and make them stop questioning why we\u2019re enforcing vaccinations. I\u2019m a SCJ, and my word has weight. The greater number of people we say are sick, the more we\u2019ll be believed.\u201d\nVice Adm. Crandall paced around the courtroom, reading slowly from the email, giving each word its owed space: \u201c\u2026the more we\u2019ll be believed. Who exactly is we? You? Fauci? Walensky? Biden? Obama? The Covid fraud is over, but you, like your associates, will bear the burden of your crimes.\u201d\n\u201cNaive man, what\u2019s over is only over because we want it that way. Covid is coming back with a bang. Just wait until after midterms. Win or lose, there\u2019ll be a Covid resurgence like you can\u2019t even imagine,\u201d Sotomayor hissed.\nVice Adm. Crandall smiled. \u201cThis commission appreciates your candor. You just freely and without coercion implicated yourself in criminal conspiracy. I was prepared to spend a few days here, entering into evidence a mountain of financial records showing the bribes you accepted to promote Covid fear. That no longer seems necessary, Mrs. Sotomayor.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a supreme court justice; address me by title,\u201d Sotomayor said.\n\u201cThe only title you have here is that of detainee,\u201d Vice Adm. Crandall replied.\nThe panel swiftly affirmed the admiral\u2019s declaration, and ruled that Sotomayor be hanged for high treason.\nA date of execution is scheduled for 28 March.",
