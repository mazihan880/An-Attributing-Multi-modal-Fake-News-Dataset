The publisher moves its 3,400 staffers into the 24 stories it is occupying, from floor 20 through 44.\nOne World Trade Center is opening 13 years after its predecessor was destroyed on September 11. There are several buildings at the site. But the centerpiece is the One World Trade Center, a skyscraper that is 104 stories and 1,776 feet tall, a height that represents the year of United States independence. This includes the 408 foot spire atop the 1,368 foot tower.\nIt's taller than the original Twin Towers, which were 1,727 feet with the antenna, or 1,362 without.\nThe building has 3.5 million square feet of space, including offices, parking and an observatory, scheduled to open next spring.\nOther tenants include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the China Center, a liaison for U.S. and Chinese businesses. But many of the floors remain unoccupied. The owners of the tower recently slashed the rent from $75 to $69 per square foot.\nLocated near Wall Street in lower Manhattan, the building was developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the 16-acre site.\nOne World Trade Center cost $3.9 billion to build. The planning and construction were complicated by fighting among developers, realtors and insurers.\nThe new building replaces the Twin Towers, which were destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, when al Qaeda terrorists flew two hijacked passenger jets into the buildings, killing 2,753 people. This was part of a wider attack that also killed hundreds of people at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania.",

Flying foxes have wingspans of 1.7 metres (5.5 ft), their bodies are quite small, barely extending 30 centimetres in length (11.8 inches).\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.\n#HoaxBuster #FactCheck",

Other prisoners included Gypsies, Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, as well as homosexuals.\nIt is estimated that as part of the Nazi terror campaign for achieving a racially acceptable Germany, over 100,000 homosexuals were arrested under Paragraph 175, the German law which outlawed homosexuality.  This resulted in an estimated 50,000 convictions, with an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 homosexuals being sent to concentration camps.\nAll who entered a concentration camp suffered and sadly many died. Several accounts indicate homosexuals who were sent to concentration camps were subject to the most horrendous labor roles, harshest punishment, and branded with a pink triangle so they could be easily identified. This includes being used as test subjects for rouge medical experiments, such as vaccine trials, castration, and \"cures\" for homosexuality.  \nIt is estimated that 55-65% of homosexuals sent to the concentration camps died during their imprisonment.\nWhile this day is recognized as a day of remembrance, it should be noted that many homosexuals were forced back into prison after being freed from the concentration camps. This due to the fact that homosexuality was illegal throughout the world. \nUnlike other survivors, it was not until the 1980s that many acknowledged the pain and suffering homosexuals suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime during World War II.\nNever forget!\n#lgbtq #lgbt #history #podcast #letstalkaboutgaystuff #instagay #gayboys #queer #gayhistory #lgbtqhistory #thisdayinhistory  #wwii #auschwitz #birkenau #auschwitzmemorial #concentrationcamp #Jews #pinktriangle #neverforget #stophate  #paragraph175 #rememberanceday #internationalholocaustremembranceday #jan27",

Prisoners that Nazis determined were homosexual were required to wear an inverdet pink trinagle on their chest.\nThe pink triangle was assigned to \u201csexual deviants.\u201d These included gay, bisexual men, as well as transgender women. \nUnder paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code, \u201csexual acts between persons of the male sex\u201d were criminalized. While lesbians were no criminalized under the law, some were still arrested by nazis for \u201canti-sociality.\u201d\nFrom 1933 to 1944, between 50 000 and 63 000 people were imprisoned on charges of homosexuality. \nGays in concentration camps were seperated from other prisoners, for fear that their sexuality was contageous. They were subject to castration and other bizarre experiments, including forced testosterone injections - which nazis administered to see if it would make them straight. \nAfter nazi concentration camps were shut down at the end of WWII, many queer prisoners were re-incarcerated.\nThe nazi laws against homosexuality remained in place until 1969. West Germany continued to imprison gay men until 1994 under a revised version of the same law. \nIn the 1970s, gay liberation advocates began to reclaim the pink triangle, turning it into a symbol of protest. It became the symbol for ACT UP, an activist group which fought for AIDS research and treatment, the group adopted the pink triangle after conservative pundit William Buckley wrote in a column that \u201ceveryone detected with AIDS should be tattooed on their buttocks.\u201d\nEach June, a 70-meter-long pink triangle is installed in the twin peak mountains of San Francisco. The triangle is a celebration of pride and a reminder of the persecution gays faced in Nazi Germany. \nRudolf Brazda was the last known survivor of the holocaust who was imprisoned for homosexuality. After the war, he moved to France and met his lifelong partner, Edi, at a costume ball. They lived together for over 30 years. Brazda died in 2011. \n#lgbtq\n #lgbt #queer #queerrights #lgbthistory #queerhistory #pinktriangle #humanrights #latvia #riga #lgbtriga #cilv\u0113kties\u012bbas #vesture",

Most operated in coastal areas due to their small size and the limited fuel supply they carried. Dating back to 1877 as an experimental venture, they later participated in the Spanish-American War and patrolled outlying waterways of the United States in later years.

The demon attached to the little girl protagonist is called \"Pan\", one of the names of Satan.\nThe Anti-hero is called \"Lord Asriel\", the word \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word Ba'al, another Canaanite demon god and Asriel means \"Prince of God\" (The prince of darkness perhaps?), and his mission, just like that of Lucifer/Satan is to kill the  \"bad guys\" in this abomination, characters called \"The Authority\" and \"Metatron\" who are none other than The Most High himself and Enoch, the righteous scribe, seventh from Adam, and in the final episode Asriel leads an army of fallen angels and men against the forces of the Most High.\nIf you wanted to teach children to hate the Most High, love Lucifer and embrace demonic possession then this series would be the way to do it...

I love everything about nature and being out in the wild places of my country, South Africa. I love the bush and the animals and having wild adventures out there. But the best thing that I love doing is taking photographs of nature. \nThe African darter is an amazing bird. It is also known as the \u2018snake bird\u2019 because of his long neck that sticks out of the water when he swims. He eats mainly fish and catches them under water.\nI was at an awesome sighting in the Kruger National Park, where this African darter was fishing. He caught many fish\u2026but one was really big!!!\nMy cousin was there with me and he took this video of it. http://bit.ly/vfxEeu\"\nIf you loved this blog post please vote for Africa Geographic\u2019s Safari blog in the 2011 SA Blog Awards.

The traditional green color we see today is extremely different from what we would have seen when it was initially built. Since it was built right on the water however, it would have oxidized relatively quickly, and because it was built in 1886, we don't have any color photographs to show what it would have looked like.\nThe reason the metal changes color is because of the moisture and elements it is subjected to. After arriving from France brown, the head of the statue of liberty would have begun to change as rain, salt, and moisture bombarded its copper exterior. As the copper interacts with these elements it slightly changes, forming a different form of basic copper consisting of a different color.",

    "content": "\"It's a common practice for many cattle farmers and became even more common after corn prices rose in 2009, according to CNN. Farmers tapped \"into the obscure market for cast-off food ingredients\" to feed their cows less expensively.\n.\nIn 2012, when CNN reported on candy as cow food, the price for a ton of corn was about $315. The price for a ton of sprinkles was as low as $160 a ton. The sugar in the candy is what the farmers want for the cows. It puts weight on them and even increases milk production. It's mixed with other forms of cattle feed, and one farmer interviewed for the CNN piece said he worked with an animal nutritionist to determine it should not be more than 3 percent of the feed.\n.\nIt's not just sugar-laden candy that's added to cattle feed to keep the cost down. The Animal Legal Defense Fund has a list of scraps from food production that can go into cattle feed including cookies, breakfast cereal, orange peels, dried fruit, taco shells, refried beans, cottonseed hulls, rice products, potato products, peanut pellets, and the byproducts of milling wheat into flour.\n.\nNot all of those additions seem as odd as candy, but none of them are what a cow would normally eat if it was grazing as it was meant to do.\"\nClick the pic to read more.\n#ourpreciousworld",

The violence, which continued through November 10 and was later dubbed \u201cKristallnacht,\u201d or \u201cNight of Broken Glass,\u201d after the countless smashed windows of Jewish-owned establishments, left approximately 100 Jews dead, 7,500 Jewish businesses damaged and hundreds of synagogues, homes, schools and graveyards vandalized. An estimated 30,000 Jewish men were arrested, many of whom were then sent to concentration camps for several months; they were released when they promised to leave Germany. Kristallnacht represented a dramatic escalation of the campaign started by Adolf Hitler in 1933 when he became chancellor to purge Germany of its Jewish population. The Nazis used the murder of a low-level German diplomat in Paris by a 17-year-old Polish Jew as an excuse to carry out the Kristallnacht attacks. On November 7, 1938, Ernst vom Rath was shot outside the German embassy by Herschel Grynszpan, who wanted revenge for his parents\u2019 sudden deportation from Germany to Poland, along with tens of thousands of other Polish Jews. Following vom Rath\u2019s death, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels ordered German storm troopers to carry out violent riots disguised as \u201cspontaneous demonstrations\u201d against Jewish citizens. Local police and fire departments were told not to interfere. In the face of all the devastation, some Jews, including entire families, died by suicide.\nIn the aftermath of Kristallnacht, the Nazis blamed the Jews and fined them 1 billion marks (or $400 million in 1938 dollars) for vom Rath\u2019s death. As repayment, the government seized Jewish property and kept insurance money owed to Jewish people. In its quest to create a master Aryan race, the Nazi government enacted further discriminatory policies that essentially excluded Jews from all aspects of public life.\nOver 100,000 Jews fled Germany for other countries after Kristallnacht. The international community was outraged by the violent events of November 9 and 10. Some countries broke off diplomatic relations in protest, but the Nazis suffered no serious consequences, leading them to believe they could get away with the mass murder that was the Holocaust, in which an estimated 6 million European Jews died.",

He spread peace throughout the Middle East, while not starting any wars although media propaganda told us he would start world war 3? But just as Biden threw open the southern border that Trump had closed to disease, pedophiles, drug-runners and illegal immigrants, Biden reversed almost everything Trump had achieved. The height was the surrender in Afghanistan of American citizens, allies, friends, the latest weapons, the crucial Bagram airbase. That was a court-martial offence. \nTrump made rules which the Beijing-Moscow-Tehran Axis, Pyongyang, and even Hamas, Hezbollah and the Taliban knew they must obey. What a shame that the Supreme Court refused to hear the strong case brought by Texas and 17 other states that the Constitution had been seriously flouted to deny Donald Trump victory in 2020. This was not only in the 2020 election. Special Counsel John Durham is revealing the facts which began even before Trump\u2019s inauguration and continued with illicit spying on the Trump White House and with the blatant lie about Russian collusion.\nCensorship of reports about the Hunter Biden laptop was so incriminating that the impact was feared even on the rigged 2020 election. \nTrump had Putin under his control and told him that if he invaded the Ukraine, Moscow would be bombed. \nMeanwhile we have the US mid-term elections this November and the Presidential election in 2024. The further decline of the United States must be stopped and for all their faults, how could we manage without them?  The future of the West, including Australia, would be dark indeed. Spending a little more on our own defense wouldn\u2019t go a miss (the money subsidising the unreliable renewables would do) and perhaps start by installing a gun or two on our unarmed patrol boats.",

This has a long time coming for me, 15 years  too long I\u2019ve had moments when I\u2019ve felt defeated and have wanted to quit, and.               I thank my husband for pushing me to ensure that I didn\u2019t for being my rock and always prioritizing my career before anything. Without you, none of this would be possible.                      The success of the U.S Army is directly related to the quality of the professional relationships between its officers and NCOs. The officer/NCO team form the cornerstone of our Army, and when the bond is formed it can have the single most important impact on unit effectiveness and efficiency.MAJ Ramses Diaz, your support today means more to me than you can imagine Because of Leaders like you, I am still here. Thank you for your leadership, Guidance, and selflessness during your time as my Commander.                                 I would like to thank my family for their continuous support.my mother and sister, who have gone out of their way to provide care and comfort to our children in our absence. I love you and I am greatful for you every single day. And finally, to our Daughters, lzabela, mila, and eliana. I hope you are watching us pay attention and take notes! Everything that we do is for you. The countless nights you\u2019ve spent without us, every hardship we\u2019ve had to endure as a family, every time we door_dash McDonalds because were too tired to cook dinner, it\u2019s all for you. I love you girl, thank you for giving me the motivation to keep going",

    "content": "Military to Miami to Protect President Trump\nBy M. B. - June 9, 2023\nWhite Hats have deployed to Miami in case the Deep State tries to unlawfully detain or disappear President Donald J. Trump on Tuesday, when he is expected to plead not guilty to fabricated federal charges that he kept classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, as well as other baseless allegations.\nOn Thursday, a \u201csecret\u201d grand jury of Biden loyalists indicted President Trump at the bequest of special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by Merrick Garland to stop Trump from assuming his rightful place in the Oval Office by any means necessary. The actual list of charges has yet to be revealed, but media outlets have speculated they run the gamut from obstructing a federal investigation to violating the Espionage Act of 1917\u2014groundless claims.\nYesterday\u2019s indictment marks the second time in a few months the Deep State has brought false charges against the lawfully elected President of the United States. The first was in March, when Trump pleaded not guilty to hush money payments surrounding the 2016 election.\nAt the time, General Eric M. Smith recommended that Trump ignore the fraudulent indictment and remain at Mar-a-Lago for his safety. Trump rejected the general\u2019s concerns, saying the Deep State wouldn\u2019t martyr him, that his demise or disappearance would spark Civil War 2.0, prompting a reminder from the general that Trump had survived many assassination attempts. Nonetheless, Trump traveled aboard Trump Force One to New York City. He had entered the courthouse and minutes later emerged unscathed.\nDuring a Thursday evening telephone call with President Trump, General Smith reiterated his concerns, a source in the general\u2019s office told Real Raw News.\n\u201cThey spoke for about 20 minutes. Once again, Gen. Smith advised Trump to stay in Palm Beach. It\u2019s his feeling Trump shouldn\u2019t acknowledge the indictment, to force the Deep State to come to him. If they think they can force their way into Mar-a-Lago again, they got another thing coming, like the Judas Priest song says,\u201d our source said.\nBut again, Trump dismissed the advice, saying he wouldn\u2019t hide in a basement like a cowardly Biden.\nGeneral Smith replied he was sending 250 troops to Miami to thwart Deep State treachery. He then upped the number to 500.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t come out of that courtroom Tuesday morning, Mr. President, we\u2019re going in scorched earth style,\u201d the general said boldly.\nTrump guessed the number of feds in Miami would outnumber White Hats five-to-one.\nGeneral Smith said that would be unfortunate\u2014for the feds.\nHe also revealed that his people had identified four members of Jack Smith\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d Grand Jury with personal or financial ties to living and dead members of the criminal Biden regime.\n\u201cThey stacked the deck,\u201d Gen. Smith told Trump.\nTrump said he would prevail and that he had a plan.\nIn closing, our source said White Hats headed to Miami are members of the Special Operations community.\nFree Speech and Alternative Media are under attack by the Deep State.

    "content": "A great lesson in Optics 101: The Monroe Doctrine (picture behind Boss). He hasn\u2019t been \u201cindicted.\u201d It\u2019s all part of the Operation \n\u201cThe Monroe Doctrine is the best known U.S. policy toward the Western Hemisphere. Buried in a routine annual message delivered to Congress by President James Monroe in December 1823, the doctrine warns European nations that the United States would not tolerate further colonization or puppet monarchs.\u201d\nMonroe Doctrine:\nhttps://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/monroe-doctrine\nThe Military Justice Act of 2016 clarifies many things\u2026 but especially that Military is SEPARATE from anything Civilian. \nWhen Donald John Trump federalized 1 million National Guard to Active-Duty that was a DIRECT MILITARY ORDER\u2026 \nAs long as he\u2019s shaving, showering, and sh*tting (Military Jargon), he holds that command. \nBecause the Military Justice Act also clarifies President and Commander-in-Chief are separate and also clarifies Commander-in-Chief are separate from Article III which is the Federal Government \nWho clarified? \n The United States Supreme Court in 2016 before they went under Continuity of Government as this Act was passed in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act \n National Essential Function found in the Federal Continuity Directives starting January 17, 2017, to most recent issue April 2023 ALL with CIC Trumps EOs and Acts in them \nIf Executive Order 13912, the Federalization of the National Guard isn't so important, how come it's been extended to March 2024? \n\"Biden\" did not terminate Proclamation 9994 from March 13, 2020, which was followed by the EO 13912, on May 12, 2023, because he is not in power as the 3 Cannons, Military Customs Funeral on January 20, 2021, displayed he was not Inaugurated, CIC Trump received the 4 Cannons / 21 Guns which is a 21 Gun Salute = Presidential Inauguration.\nIt's also CIC Trump's EO 13818 that pairs with the December 2016 Global Magnitsky Act that declared WAR on all Human Rights Abuse = Drug Trafficking, Human Trafficking, Sex Trafficking, and Child Trafficking, along with protection of whistleblowers and those being hazed for exposing these evil people. \nOnce you understand the importance of the Military Justice Act plus the timeline of these Laws and Orders... you'll understand you're watching the greatest Sting Operation in World History take place and they're providing nuggets via visuals. \nThe same Title 10 that CIC Trump federalized the 1 million to Active-Duty which is active until March 2024, is the same Title 10 that every single Veteran alive and passed plus all in Active-Duty, National Guard, and Reserve components swore in under. You cannot believe in one without the other. \nThe same with Military Customs... 4 Cannons with 21 Guns (Rounds fired) = 21 Gun Salute. 3 Cannons with 21 Guns does not equal a 21 Gun Salute, it's a Funeral Service. Arlington Cemetery dot MIL specifically points this out. \nA little over a month after CIC Trump federalized the NG to Active-Duty, he signed EO 13919... \nAnd this is where your Optic 101 comes in after ALL of the pictures I post of showing how the National Guard have been out of their State Jurisdictions and U.S. Jurisdiction every single day since those Orders were given... \nCIC Trump passed this in EO 13919:\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 12304 of title 10, United States Code, and having determined that it is necessary to augment the regular Armed Forces of the United States for a named operational mission, specifically the \u201cEnhanced Department of Defense Counternarcotic Operation in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d I hereby order as follows...\nWESTERN HEMISPHERE.  \nThat 10 US Code 12304 specifically says: \n A member who is ordered to active duty under this section may be required to serve on active duty until his total service on active duty equals 24 months. If his enlistment or other period of military service would expire before he has served the required period under this section, it may be extended until he has served the required period.\n10 USC 12304:\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/.../USCODE-2021-title10-subtitleE...   \n-- \nNONE of the Executive Orders that \"Biden\" has extended would benefit he or any of the evil RINOS and DINOS aka the Swamp whatsoever... \nAnd keep in mind... \n3 Cannons = Funeral Service\n21 Guns = Reigning Monarch\nNumber of Guns:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21-gun_salute\nThe 21-gun salute is not to be confused with the three-volley salute (or three-rifle volley) rendered at military honors funerals, which you might see or hear at Arlington National Cemetery. \nArlington:\nhttps://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/.../Cerem.../21-Gun-Salute\nOnce again... 4 Cannons = Inauguration with 21 Guns = 21 Gun Salute.\nOptics 101... it all adds up once you start with the Blueprint from top to bottom\nThe Monroe Doctrine\u2026 Western Hemisphere ",

    "content": "After House Republicans voted to remove Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) from her House leadership post, and she pledged to make sure Donald J. Trump never gets \u201cnear the Oval Office again,\u201d the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps drafted a sealed indictment charging her with treason and other high crimes against America and its citizenry.\nThe long overdue indictment was signed and sealed after lawmakers gave JAG evidence that tied Cheney to ballot harvesting in her home state, proof that treasonous Cheney is nothing less than a Democrat in disguise. On election night, as Trump was trouncing Biden in Wyoming by 40 percentage points, Cheney was on the phone begging state election officers in 5 precincts to stop tallying Republican votes. Moreover, she verbally assailed Wyoming Secretary of State Edward Buchanan (R) for supporting a \u201ccriminal candidate.\u201d\nCheney\u2019s election night antics and hatred of Trump coalesced into sheer lunacy on Jan 6 when she blamed Trump for the Capitol riots, demanding his impeachment, and labelling him \u201can insurrectionist\u201d guilty of sedition. After failing to rally Republican support, she unprofessionally, unethically, and illegally asked Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance to hasten the state\u2019s tax fraud investigation on Donald Trump.\nWorse, she harangued Trump\u2019s eldest children\u2014Don Jr., Eric, and Ivanka\u2014with a ceaseless barrage of emails and voicemails, demanding they pressure Trump to stay in New York or Florida, anywhere but Washington D.C.\n\u201cIt was criminal harassment but had nothing to do with the indictment. The Trumps have the thickest skins of any human beings on the planet, and they blew Liz Cheney off as loony toons, a crazy Karen,\u201d our source said.\nA \u201cKaren\u201d is pejorative slang for a meddlesome, self-entitled, middle-aged Caucasian female who inappropriately insinuates herself into other people\u2019s lives.\n\u201cThe indictment is because she betrayed her oath of office and subverted the United States Constitution for personal gain.  It was JAG that chose to indict her,\u201d our source said.\nThe indictment, however, does not signal an immediate arrest. Our source said JAG is curating a cornucopia of indictments, deciding which to act on first. Persons currently basking in media limelight, such as Anthony Fauci, are being shuffled to the back of the pile, while the military targets criminals whose public exposure has diminished, as they are easier to apprehend without drawing unwanted public scrutiny. Regardless, the vilest Deep State villains\u2014and their minions\u2014will eventually face military justice.",

    "content": "Radical Muslim Operation Warp Speed Architect Hanged at GITMO\nBy Michael Baxter -March 29, 2023\n\u201cAllahu Akbar,\u201d convicted felon Moncef Slaoui shouted Monday morning as he stood atop the gallows at Guantanamo Bay and leered menacingly at the man he held responsible for ordering his imminent death.\nBelow him, Vice Adm. Darse E. Crandall and a few high-ranking officers watched in silence while the hangman standing beside Slaoui slipped a braided rope around his neck. Slaoui struggled but was no match for the towering soldier who effortlessly pinned Slaoui\u2019s wrists to his back, then bound them with a zip tie. Slaoui spat in the soldier\u2019s face.\n\u201cBag the prisoner,\u201d Adm. Crandall ordered, and the soldier put a black hood over Slaoui\u2019s head.\n\u201cHow\u2019s that appeal coming along?\u201d Adm. Crandall bellowed.\nAt the end of Slaoui\u2019s tribunal last Thursday, his lawyer, Omar Akbar, promised to appeal the verdict to an unspecified authority. He caught the first flight leaving GITMO Thursday afternoon and hadn\u2019t been heard from since; Slaoui\u2019s calls to Akbar\u2019s office in D.C. went unanswered.\n\u201cIt once amazed me, Mr. Slaoui, how little regard you people have for human life. Like others who stood where you are now, you were consumed by greed, which has led to this ineluctable fate. \u201cI didn\u2019t put you on gallows; you put yourself there,\u201d Adm. Crandall said, and motioned at the soldier to push the button.\nBut the hinged door beneath Slaoui\u2019s feet did not swing open.\n\u201cIt\u2019s broken, sir,\u201d the soldier said.\n\u201cAllah speaks,\u201d Slaoui muttered from underneath his hood. \u201cHe\u2019s not ready to receive me yet.\u201d\nAdm. Crandall said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be ready as soon as I can get an electrician here, so don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d\nWhile they awaited the arrival of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers electrician, Slaoui hurled Arabic curses at the admiral, calling him an impious infidel, a blasphemer, and an enemy of Allah. He said Allah and His Messenger would avenge him.\nThe electrician arrived 30 minutes later and tested the box, pushing the green and red buttons after the soldier had moved Slaoui aside. He removed the cover and began fiddling with the wires, commenting that his visit marked the second time in two years a connection had come loose. He fixed it in five minutes, then tested the circuit, pressing the green button to open the door and the red one to close it.\n\u201cAll done, Admiral,\u201d he said, and left the platform.\nThe soldier positioned Slaoui, who hadn\u2019t shut his mouth, over the door.\nAdmiral Crandall had fitting final words for the Operation Warp Speed architect. \u201cMay you reach your next destination at warp 9.\u201d\n\u201cAllah is gre\u2014\u201d Slaoui began, but his neck snapped before he had a chance to finish his sentence.\nA U.S. Navy physician pronounced Slaoui dead at 10:47 a.m. EST.\n(Visited 8,572 times, 8,572 visits today)",

    "content": "DeSantis Denied Entry to GITMO Again; Military Threatens to Shoot Him Down\nBy Michael Baxter -March 26, 2023\nFor reasons unknown, Florida Governor and presumptive presidential candidate Ron DeSantis seems desperate to once again access Guantanamo Bay, the infamous detention center where he, as a junior Navy officer, allegedly authorized the force-feeding of Jihadi detainees, a process that involves strapping them to a chair and jamming a lubricated tube down their throats. DeSantis has categorically denied authorizing or witnessing such incidents, saying in an interview with Piers Morgan, \u201cI didn\u2019t have authority to authorize anything. There may have been a commander that would have done feeding if someone was going to die, but that was not something that I would have even had authority to do.\u201d That was in 2006, when DeSantis was a Navy Lieutenant as part of its Judge Advocate General\u2019s corps \u2013 serving as a military lawyer.\nIn August 2021, DeSantis had a renewed interest in visiting his old post. He toured the base with Vice Adm. Crandall, stopping at the administration buildings and at Camp Delta before boarding a private jet for his trip back to Florida.\nHis visit caused a stir among White Hats. Both Generals Berger and Smith asked Adm. Crandall and GITMO leadership to forbid DeSantis entry, claiming they had evidence proving the Sunshine State\u2019s governor was a Deep State sympathizer, collaborator, or both, and a card-carrying member of Skull & Bones.\n\u201cIf DeSantis is who we think he is, and we\u2019re pretty sure, he has no business at Guantanamo Bay,\u201d a liaison to Adm. Crandall told Real Raw News.\nWhen DeSantis in February tried to schedule a follow up visit, GITMO staff told his spokesperson, Christina Pushaw, that GITMO was closed to uninvited visitors.\nThe rebuff, however, has not stopped Pushaw and other persons in DeSantis\u2019 camp from flooding GITMO\u2019s phones with requests and demands.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting four, five, or six calls a day, all saying DeSantis must come to GITMO. He never makes the calls, it\u2019s always one of his representatives, and we\u2019ve told them if we want to see DeSantis, we\u2019ll call him. Until then, he\u2019s persona non grata,\u201d our source said.\nBut still they kept calling, each time sounding more belligerent and forceful, until finally Adm. Crandall personally told Pushaw that \u201cDeep State DeSantis\u201d had forfeit his right to visit GITMO for collaborating with FEMA Director Denise Criswell during Hurricane Ian, when FEMA agents pillaged homes of displaced storm victims.\n\u201cI think that call happened during the second week of March. The persistent calls stopped for a while, and we thought finally DeSantis took a hint. Well, we were wrong, and on March 23rd the calls started again,\u201d our source said.\nPushaw, he said, gave an ultimatum: either grant DeSantis permission to land at Leeward Point Airfield, or he\u2019d come anyway. GITMO leadership discussed the situation with Gen. Smith, who said he would deal with DeSantis\u2019 people.\nA day later, Gen. Smith spoke to Pushaw and issued a stark warning: if DeSantis approached GITMO by air or by sea, he would be declared an enemy combatant and fired upon. She reportedly called Gen. Smith \u201ca monster\u201d and hung up on him.\nWe asked our source a hypothetical question: Is it possible that GITMO has calamitous info on DeSantis that could ruin his presidential aspirations, unflattering info DeSantis might want destroyed.\n\u201cI can\u2019t confirm or deny that. I just know he\u2019s unwelcome here,\u201d our source said.\nFree Speech and Alternative Media are under attack by the Deep State.

More than France and Germany combined. )\nThese men, deployed to the woods of a single American state, Wisconsin, to hunt with firearms,\nand NO ONE WAS KILLED.\nThat number pales in comparison to the 750,000 who hunted the woods ofPennsylvania and\nMichigan 's 700,000 hunters, ALL OF WHOM HAVE RETURNED HOME SAFELY.\nToss in a quarter million hunters in West Virginia and it literally establishes the fact that the\nhunters of those four states alone would comprise the largest army in the world.\nAnd then add in the total number of hunters in the other 46 states.\nIt's millions more.\n________ The point? _______________________________________\nAmerica will forever be safe from foreign invasion with that kind of home-grown firepower!\nHunting... it's not just a way to fill the freezer.\nIt's a matter of national security.\n***************************************\nThat's why all enemies, foreign and domestic, want to see us disarmed.\nFood for thought, when next we consider gun control, whether you agree with it or not.\nOverall it's true, so if we disregard some assumptions that hunters\ndon't possess the same skills as soldiers, the question would still remain...\nWhat army of 2 million would want to face 30 million, 40 million, or 50 million armed citizens???\nFor the sake of our freedom, don't ever allow gun control or confiscation of guns.\n(IF YOU AGREE, AS I DO, PASS IT ON, I FEEL GOOD THAT I HAVE AN ARMY OF MILLIONS WHO WOULD PROTECT OUR LAND AND I SURE DON'T WANT\nTHE GOVERNMENT TAKING CONTROL OF THE POSSESSION OF FIREARMS)\nGOD BLESS AMERICA!!\nMarv Grandstaff",

And proudly spoke Yiddish fluently.\nIn memory of this family and until the end of his life, he wore the Star of David and said that in this family he learned \"to live a real life and determination.\"\nThis little boy's name was Louis Armstrong.",
