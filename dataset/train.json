Multiple Special Forces members & US military leaders, & even Rob O'Neill,  who was the gunman who actually shot & killed Osama bin Laden, under Obama, suggested  \"this Baghdadi mission was much more dangerous & complex than the bin Laden mission.\"  As comparison -- when bin Laden was killed many Conservatives/Republicans spoke highly & respectfully of Obama - such as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Rudy Giuliani, and yes,even Donald Trump, made very gracious & appreciative statements.  BUT the Left could not express ANYTHING POSITIVE towards President Trump over Al-Baghdadi's death, along with the 2nd Isis in command, as well -- as this mission was a phenomenal victory, not only for the US, but for many countries around the world, who continue to battle Isis and other terrorist groups that continue to murder innocent people! The mission, was code-named Operation Kayla Mueller, in honor of a young American goodwill worker, who was abducted, tortured, raped & killed by Al-Baghdadi.  Kayla's parents expressed humble & tearful extreme appreciation to Pres. Trump & our incredible Special Ops team. GOD BLESS President Trump & our brave, devoted & incredible military/Special Services/Ops teams!! Oh, and Conan the brilliant dog who had a major role in this mission!",

Rather than flee, the ship\u2019s commander Richard W. Meade, Jr., nephew of George Gordon Meade, emerged on the deck in his nightclothes and ordered the vessel to close with the enemy\u2019s guns. Soon, two other naval ships arrived to assist Marblehead and the Confederates were forced to abandon their positions, leaving behind two howitzers. Marblehead suffered three killed and four wounded, as well as damaged that required the ship to leave station for repairs.  \nFour members of Marblehead\u2019s crew received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the engagement. Boatswain Mate William Farley was decorated for his command of the 11-inch gun along, encouragement of the men, and ability to maintain a high rate of fire. Severely wounded, Landsman Charles Moore maintained his station until forced to go below deck from loss of blood. Quartermaster James Miller received the Medal of Honor for continually taking soundings while under fire.  \nFreed from slavery during a Union raid on the Santee River in June 1862, Robert Blake answered the call to serve when the Navy asked for volunteers. Blake, who had been serving as Marblehead\u2019s cook, immediately began distributing powder to the gunners after the powder boy was killed by a shell that also knocked Blake to the deck. Receiving the Medal of Honor in 1864, Robert Blake was the first Black soldier to be presented the decoration. William Harvey Carney\u2019s action at Fort Wagner occurred in July 1863, however, so while he received his medal in 1900, he is recognized as the first Black recipient.",

    "content": "Question: \"Why should I believe in Christ\u2019s resurrection?\"\nAnswer: It is a fairly well-established fact that Jesus Christ was publicly executed in Judea in the 1st Century A.D., under Pontius Pilate, by means of crucifixion, at the behest of the Jewish Sanhedrin. The non-Christian historical accounts of Flavius Josephus, Cornelius Tacitus, Lucian of Samosata, Maimonides and even the Jewish Sanhedrin corroborate the early Christian eyewitness accounts of these important historical aspects of the death of Jesus Christ. \nAs for His resurrection, there are several lines of evidence which make for a compelling case. The late jurisprudential prodigy and international statesman Sir Lionel Luckhoo (of The Guinness Book of World Records fame for his unprecedented 245 consecutive defense murder trial acquittals) epitomized Christian enthusiasm and confidence in the strength of the case for the resurrection when he wrote, \u201cI have spent more than 42 years as a defense trial lawyer appearing in many parts of the world and am still in active practice. I have been fortunate to secure a number of successes in jury trials and I say unequivocally the evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is so overwhelming that it compels acceptance by proof which leaves absolutely no room for doubt.\u201d\nThe secular community\u2019s response to the same evidence has been predictably apathetic in accordance with their steadfast commitment to methodological naturalism. For those unfamiliar with the term, methodological naturalism is the human endeavor of explaining everything in terms of natural causes and natural causes only. If an alleged historical event defies natural explanation (e.g., a miraculous resurrection), secular scholars generally treat it with overwhelming skepticism, regardless of the evidence, no matter how favorable and compelling it may be.\nIn our view, such an unwavering allegiance to natural causes regardless of substantive evidence to the contrary is not conducive to an impartial (and therefore adequate) investigation of the evidence. We agree with Dr. Wernher von Braun and numerous others who still believe that forcing a popular philosophical predisposition upon the evidence hinders objectivity. Or in the words of Dr. von Braun, \u201cTo be forced to believe only one conclusion\u2026 would violate the very objectivity of science itself.\u201d\nHaving said that, let us now examine the several lines of evidence which favor of the resurrection. \nThe First Line of Evidence for Christ's resurrection\nTo begin with, we have demonstrably sincere eyewitness testimony. Early Christian apologists cited hundreds of eyewitnesses, some of whom documented their own alleged experiences. Many of these eyewitnesses willfully and resolutely endured prolonged torture and death rather than repudiate their testimony. This fact attests to their sincerity, ruling out deception on their part. According to the historical record (The Book of Acts 4:1-17; Pliny\u2019s Letters to Trajan X, 96, etc) most Christians could end their suffering simply by renouncing the faith. Instead, it seems that most opted to endure the suffering and proclaim Christ\u2019s resurrection unto death.\nGranted, while martyrdom is remarkable, it is not necessarily compelling. It does not validate a belief so much as it authenticates a believer (by demonstrating his or her sincerity in a tangible way). What makes the earliest Christian martyrs remarkable is that they knew whether or not what they were professing was true. They either saw Jesus Christ alive-and-well after His death or they did not. This is extraordinary. If it was all just a lie, why would so many perpetuate it given their circumstances? Why would they all knowingly cling to such an unprofitable lie in the face of persecution, imprisonment, torture, and death?\nWhile the September 11, 2001, suicide hijackers undoubtedly believed what they professed (as evidenced by their willingness to die for it), they could not and did not know if it was true. They put their faith in traditions passed down to them over many generations. In contrast, the early Christian martyrs were the first generation. Either they saw what they claimed to see, or they did not.\nAmong the most illustrious of the professed eyewitnesses were the Apostles. They collectively underwent an undeniable change following the alleged post-resurrection appearances of Christ. Immediately following His crucifixion, they hid in fear for their lives. Following the resurrection they took to the streets, boldly proclaiming the resurrection despite intensifying persecution. What accounts for their sudden and dramatic change? It certainly was not financial gain. The Apostles gave up everything they had to preach the resurrection, including their lives.\nThe Second Line of Evidence for Christ's resurrection\nA second line of evidence concerns the conversion of certain key skeptics, most notably Paul and James. Paul was of his own admission a violent persecutor of the early Church. After what he described as an encounter with the resurrected Christ, Paul underwent an immediate and drastic change from a vicious persecutor of the Church to one of its most prolific and selfless defenders. Like many early Christians, Paul suffered impoverishment, persecution, beatings, imprisonment, and execution for his steadfast commitment to Christ\u2019s resurrection.\nJames was skeptical, though not as hostile as Paul. A purported post-resurrection encounter with Christ turned him into an inimitable believer, a leader of the Church in Jerusalem. We still have what scholars generally accept to be one of his letters to the early Church. Like Paul, James willingly suffered and died for his testimony, a fact which attests to the sincerity of his belief (see The Book of Acts and Josephus\u2019 Antiquities of the Jews XX, ix, 1).\nThe Third and Fourth Lines of Evidence for Christ's resurrection\nA third line and fourth line of evidence concern enemy attestation to the empty tomb and the fact that faith in the resurrection took root in Jerusalem. Jesus was publicly executed and buried in Jerusalem. It would have been impossible for faith in His resurrection to take root in Jerusalem while His body was still in the tomb where the Sanhedrin could exhume it, put it on public display, and thereby expose the hoax. Instead, the Sanhedrin accused the disciples of stealing the body, apparently in an effort to explain its disappearance (and therefore an empty tomb). How do we explain the fact of the empty tomb? Here are the three most common explanations:\nFirst, the disciples stole the body. If this were the case, they would have known the resurrection was a hoax. They would not therefore have been so willing to suffer and die for it. (See the first line of evidence concerning demonstrably sincere eyewitness testimony.) All of the professed eyewitnesses would have known that they hadn\u2019t really seen Christ and were therefore lying. With so many conspirators, surely someone would have confessed, if not to end his own suffering then at least to end the suffering of his friends and family. The first generation of Christians were absolutely brutalized, especially following the conflagration in Rome in A.D. 64 (a fire which Nero allegedly ordered to make room for the expansion of his palace, but which he blamed on the Christians in Rome in an effort to exculpate himself). As the Roman historian Cornelius Tacitus recounted in his Annals of Imperial Rome (published just a generation after the fire):\n\u201cNero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, whe daylight had expired.\u201d (Annals, XV, 44)\nNero illuminated his garden parties with Christians whom he burnt alive. Surely someone would have confessed the truth under the threat of such terrible pain. The fact is, however, we have no record of any early Christian denouncing the faith to end his suffering. Instead, we have multiple accounts of post-resurrection appearances and hundreds of eyewitnesses willing to suffer and die for it.\nIf the disciples didn\u2019t steal the body, how else do we explain the empty tomb? Some have suggested that Christ faked His death and later escaped from the tomb. This is patently absurd. According to the eyewitness testimony, Christ was beaten, tortured, lacerated, and stabbed. He suffered internal damage, massive blood loss, asphyxiation, and a spear through His heart. There is no good reason to believe that Jesus Christ (or any other man for that matter) could survive such an ordeal, fake His death, sit in a tomb for three days and nights without medical attention, food or water, remove the massive stone which sealed His tomb, escape undetected (without leaving behind a trail of blood), convince hundreds of eyewitnesses that He was resurrected from the death and in good health, and then disappear without a trace. Such a notion is ridiculous.\nThe Fifth Line of Evidence for Christ's resurrection\nFinally, a fifth line of evidence concerns a peculiarity of the eyewitness testimony. In all of the major resurrection narratives, women are credited as the first and primary eyewitnesses. This would be an odd invention since in both the ancient Jewish and Roman cultures women were severely disesteemed. Their testimony was regarded as insubstantial and dismissible. Given this fact, it is highly unlikely that any perpetrators of a hoax in 1st Century Judea would elect women to be their primary witnesses. Of all the male disciples who claimed to see Jesus resurrected, if they all were lying and the resurrection was a scam, why did they pick the most ill-perceived, distrusted witnesses they could find?\nDr. William Lane Craig explains, \u201cWhen you understand the role of women in first-century Jewish society, what's really extraordinary is that this empty tomb story should feature women as the discoverers of the empty tomb in the first place. Women were on a very low rung of the social ladder in first-century Palestine. There are old rabbinical sayings that said, 'Let the words of Law be burned rather than delivered to women' and 'blessed is he whose children are male, but woe to him whose children are female.' Women's testimony was regarded as so worthless that they weren't even allowed to serve as legal witnesses in a Jewish court of Law. In light of this, it's absolutely remarkable that the chief witnesses to the empty tomb are these women... Any later legendary account would have certainly portrayed male disciples as discovering the tomb - Peter or John, for example. The fact that women are the first witnesses to the empty tomb is most plausibly explained by the reality that like it or not - they were the discoverers of the empty tomb! This shows that the Gospel writers faithfully recorded what happened, even if it was embarrassing. This bespeaks the historicity of this tradition rather than its legendary status.\" (Dr. William Lane Craig, quoted by Lee Strobel, The Case For Christ, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1998, p. 293)\nIn Summary\nThese lines of evidence: the demonstrable sincerity of the eyewitnesses (and in the Apostles\u2019 case, compelling, inexplicable change), the conversion and demonstrable sincerity of key antagonists- and skeptics-turned-martyrs, the fact of the empty tomb, enemy attestation to the empty tomb, the fact that all of this took place in Jerusalem where faith in the resurrection began and thrived, the testimony of the women, the significance of such testimony given the historical context; all of these strongly attest to the historicity of the resurrection. We encourage our readers to thoughtfully consider these evidences. What do they suggest to you? Having pondered them ourselves, we resolutely affirm Sir Lionel\u2019s declaration:\n\u201cThe evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is so overwhelming that it compels acceptance by proof which leaves absolutely no room for doubt.\u201d\nRecommended Resource: The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus by Gary Habermas.",

The scruffy immature is dark brown and mottled with white on head. In flight the white windows in the wings and pale, dark-tipped tail make the juvenile distinctive. It catches fish with a graceful, shallow plunge to the water\u2019s surface, but it will also eat birds, reptiles, and carrion.

We thought we would create a page where everyone can share their pictures and we can share Wyatt\u2019s story!!! \nWyatt\u2019s lemonade stand started in 2020 with the goal for him to purchase a lego. Wyatt would have a free lemonade stand and in turn for his hard work mom and dad would purchase the lego after Rally. Little did we know what we were in for. After generous donations started coming in we decided we would need to restructure where donations would go. Some goes to savings, some to a charity of Wyatt\u2019s choice, and a little for spending. The first year Wyatt ended up being able to donate $200 to St. Jude Childrens Hospital. \nIn 2021 Wyatt had a goal to make $1200 over the course of the Sturgis Rally. On day one we met Tracy who was camping at the campground next to the house and the journey would begin. Tracy posted on a Sturgis page about the stand and that post was copied, added to, and shared over 47k times\u2026.the rally adopted Wyatt, Wyatt\u2019s Lemonade was born, and in 2021\nWyatt donated over $32,000 to St. Jude!!!! \nIn 2022 Wyatt had visitors from all 50 states and over 20 countries at the stand. He was able to donate $21,000 to St. Jude!\nWyatt continues to run his free lemonade stand during the Sturgis Rally each year as well as special events throughout the year. Please check out his website at www.wyattslemonade.com for available merch and updates. \nVenmo:@wyattslemonade",

(One particularly emotional video is here). And some New Zealanders even turned in their semi-automatic weapons to authorities. \"This is one of the easiest decisions I have ever made,\" said one gun-owner who had owned a firearm for 31 years.\nJacinda Ardern, the nation\u2019s prime minister, has proved a model of compassion and efficiency, showing up before the Muslim community in a hijab as a sign of respect and earning praise worldwide. \"She symbolically covers her head when she goes to a home for condolences; she boldly underlines her respect and solidarity,\" wrote Turkish lawmaker Cihangir Islam. \"How thirsty we have become for justice and mercy in state administration.\"\n\"We represent diversity, kindness, compassion,\" Ardern said Friday. \"A home for those who share our values.

In the United States, the founding and development of the Anglo-American settler-state involves a narrative about Puritan settlers who had a covenant with God to take the land. That part of the origin story is supported and reinforced by the Columbus myth and the \u201cDoctrine of Discovery.\u201d According to a series of late-fifteenth-century papal bulls, European nations acquired title to the lands they \u201cdiscovered\u201d and the Indigenous inhabitants lost their natural right to that land after Europeans arrived and claimed it. [5] As law professor Robert A. Williams observes about the Doctrine of Discovery:\nResponding to the requirements of a paradoxical age of Renaissance and Inquisition, the West\u2019s first modern discourses of conquest articulated a vision of all humankind united under a rule of law discoverable solely by human reason. Unfortunately for the American Indian, the West\u2019s first tentative steps towards this noble vision of a Law of Nations contained a mandate for Europe\u2019s subjugation of all peoples whose radical divergence from European-derived norms of right conduct signified their need for conquest and remediation. \nThe Columbus myth suggests that from US independence onward, colonial settlers saw themselves as part of a world system of colonization. \u201cColumbia,\u201d the poetic, Latinate name used in reference to the United States from its founding throughout the nineteenth century, was based on the name of Christopher Columbus. The \u201cLand of Columbus\u201d was\u2014and still is\u2014represented by the image of a woman in sculptures and paintings, by institutions such as Columbia University, and by countless place names, including that of the national capital, the District of Columbia. The 1798 hymn \u201cHail, Columbia\u201d was the early national anthem and is now used whenever the vice president of the United States makes a public appearance, and Columbus Day is still a federal holiday despite Columbus never having set foot on any territory ever claimed by the United States.\"\nhttps://www.google.com/.../how-we-are-often-trapped.../amp/",

It takes a dream.\" (Lady Bird Johnson, Padre Island National Seashore dedication, April 8, 1968) \nWith these words, the First Lady of the United States dedicated Padre Island National Seashore, the longest stretch of undeveloped barrier island in the world. She addressed a crowd that included Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, National Park Service Director George Hartzog, Senator Ralph Yarborough of Texas, and other dignitaries. In her remarks, she recognized the hard work required to create the park, and the vision and leadership of her husband in expanding the National Park System. She used the President\u2019s phrase, a ''necklace of national seashores,\" to describe the \u2018163 linear miles of shoreline newly preserved.\u2019 \nOn a personal note, she recalled her and her husband\u2019s \u201clovely holiday we had some 20 years ago along these ribbons of sand in the Texas Gulf Coast. My mind turns back to it today, for we walked the beach and felt that sense of timelessness that envelops one like the rolling waves. There is always an ineffable tranquility in which you are face to face with sea and sky --forces which put one's own problems into perspective.\u201d\nIn closing, Mrs. Johnson dedicated the National Seashore \u201cto the people who will come here to enjoy God's bounty. I dedicate it with the hope that we --as its stewards --will be worthy of the trust.\u201d\nHave any of you visited Padre Island or other national seashores? Feel free to tell us about it!\n#PadreIslandNationalSeashore #EnvironmentalMovement #LadyBirdJohnsonNationalParkService\n(Photos: Lady Bird Johnson at Padre Island National Seashore, Robert Knudsen/LBJ Library; Lady Bird Johnson at the dedication of Padre Island National Seashore, April 8, 1968, image no longer available, from Padre Island NS Division of Sea Turtle Science & Recovery Facebook page)",

    "content": "Here's a little report from our Croatian Savage Gear consultant, Dalien Vignjevic: \n'Ultra light fishing is becoming one of the most popular ways of fishing these days. No wonder. It delivers instant action and joy even with small fish . Today was a bit different. We were catching some serious trout that  hatch naturally in this heavily pressured clear and fast flowing water.\n  Getting an old rainbow trout to bite is not an easy task. Your best bet is seeing a big one, then sit on it and repeatedly present the lure as close as possible until she takes it. To sit on a fish for half an hour in not a long time. No standard trout lures work here, just tiny nymphs and gamarus so Fly fisherman had advantage because of the small  flies trout seem to take with less caution. Well not any more...\nNew SG Trutizimo ultra light rod allowed me to present small 1,5-2 gram jigs with nymph imitations on the shank  as far and as deep as I wanted.  Beside incredible launch thrust of  extremely small baits this rod has enough power to land 2,5 kg fish like this in really strong current. The intensity of landing this marvelous fish with all of  jumping, pulling and other crazy stuff   is something I will never forget. I  have to mention 0,15 mm Okuma SeaMax flourocarbon tippet on 8 LB braid that withheld all of mayhem during the 15 minute fight with this \"native\" old trout.\nI cant remember last time I was that happy and it all goes with Ultra Light approach...\n Check the final moments video of what was a 15 minute fight on http://dalien-fishing.com/ultra-light-trout-clip/'",

Staying hopeful the 5 men inside are still alive and can be saved before oxygen runs out tomorrow\u2026but dang it\u2019s terrifying!\nEdited to add audio! 5 knocks each time. THREE p3 military planes heard the same sounds and that\u2019s where they\u2019ve mobilized for now. They ALSO confirmed that they heard knocks again this morning! \nUPDATE: The Atalante (French ship) has the Victor 6000 which is an ROV that can dive 2x the depth of the Titanic and has many times...most importantly, it also has robotic arms to be able to free them if they are stuck somewhere OR attach a cable to lift it out of the bottom. Only issue is, The Atalante doesn't have the cable/crane. The cable capable of reaching and lifting the sub is on the Horizon Arctic ship which is further out. It seems both should be there in a few hours. Atalante went past the site and went straight to the Horizon Arctic instead, which makes me think they KNOW where the Titan (no need to have the Atalante stop and dive yet... and instead they want to plan/prepare to drop both the cable and the Victor at the same time to save time and going to meet the HA gives them time to do that vs. sitting and waiting and then having to rush (just a guess).

I personally agree with every word:\nHe donated \u00a385 million to combat the virus last month \u2013 and believes that despite the chaos, there is \u2018a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens\u2019.\nFrom Bill Gates:\n\u2018A SPIRITUAL PURPOSE\u2019\n\u201cI\u2019m a strong believer that there is a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens, whether that is what we perceive as being good or being bad.\n\u201cAs I meditate upon this, I want to share with you what I feel the Corona/ Covid-19 virus is really doing to us.\n1) It is reminding us that we are all equal, regardless of our culture, religion, occupation, financial situation or how famous we are. This disease treats us all equally, perhaps we should to.\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Tom Hanks.\n2) It is reminding us that we are all connected and something that affects one person has an effect on another.\nIt is reminding us that the false borders that we have put up have little value as this virus does not need a passport.\nIt is reminding us, by oppressing us for a short time, of those in this world whose whole life is spent in oppression.\n3) It is reminding us of how precious our health is and how we have moved to neglect it through eating nutrient poor manufactured food and drinking water that is contaminated with chemicals upon chemicals.\nIf we don\u2019t look after our health, we will, of course, get sick.\n4) It is reminding us of the shortness of life and of what is most important for us to do, which is to help each other, especially those who are old or sick.\nOur purpose is not to buy toilet roll.\n5) It is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how, when in times of difficulty, we remember that it\u2019s the essentials that we need (food, water, medicine) as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to.\n6) It is reminding us of how important our family and home life is and how much we have neglected this.\nIt is forcing us back into our houses so we can rebuild them into our home and to strengthen our family unit.\n\u2018OUR TRUE WORK\u2019\n7) It is reminding us that our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do.\nOur true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another.\n It is reminding us to keep our egos in check.\nIt is reminding us that no matter how great we think we are or how great others think we are, a virus can bring our world to a standstill.\n9) It is reminding us that the power of freewill is in our hands.\nWe can choose to cooperate and help each other, to share, to give, to help and to support each other or we can choose to be selfish, to hoard, to look after only our self.\nIndeed, it is difficulties that bring out our true colours.\n10) It is reminding us that we can be patient, or we can panic.\nWe can either understand that this type of situation has happened many times before in history and will pass, or we can panic and see it as the end of the world and, consequently, cause ourselves more harm than good.\n11) It is reminding us that this can either be an end or a new beginning.\nThis can be a time of reflection and understanding, where we learn from our mistakes, or it can be the start of a cycle which will continue until we finally learn the lesson we are meant to.\n12) It is reminding us that this Earth is sick.\nIt is reminding us that we need to look at the rate of deforestation just as urgently as we look at the speed at which toilet rolls are disappearing off of shelves. We are sick because our home is sick.\n13) It is reminding us that after every difficulty, there is always ease.\nLife is cyclical, and this is just a phase in this great cycle. We do not need to panic; this too shall pass.\n14) Whereas many see the Corona/ Covid-19 virus as a great disaster, I prefer to see it as a *great corrector*\nIt is sent to remind us of the important lessons that we seem to have forgotten and it is up to us if we will learn them or not.",

    "content": "TODAYS HISTORY LESSON\nDid you know President Obama has been running a shadow government trying to subvert a sitting President and destroy America. Charles Krauthammer knew.\nBy Charles Krauthammer\nI do not understand how living in a country with its democracy established over 200 years ago, and now, for the first time in history, suddenly we have one of our former presidents set up a group called \"Organizing for Action\" (OFA).\nOFA is 30,000+ strong and working to disrupt everything that our current president\u2019s administration is trying to do. This organization goes against our Democracy, and it is an operation that will destroy our way of governing. It goes against our Constitution, our laws, and the processes established over 200 years ago. If it is allowed to proceed then we will be living in chaos very much like third world countries are run. What good is it to have an established government if it is not going to be respected and allowed to follow our laws?\nIf you had an army some 30,000 strong and a court system stacked over the decades with judges who would allow you to break the laws, how much damage could you do to a country? We are about to find out in America!\nOur ex-president said he was going to stay involved through community organizing and speak out on the issues and that appears to be one post-administration promise he intends to keep. He has moved many of his administration's top dogs over to Organizing for Action.\nOFA is behind the strategic and tactical implementation of the resistance to the Trump Administration that we are seeing across America, and politically active courts are providing the leverage for this revolution.\nOFA is dedicated to organizing communities for \"progressive\" change. Its issues are gun control, socialist healthcare, abortion, sexual equality, climate change, and of course, immigration reform.\nOFA members were propped up by the ex-president's message from the shadows: \"Organizing is the building block of everything great we have accomplished Organizers around the country are fighting for change in their communities and OFA is one of the groups on the front lines. Commit to this work in 2017 and beyond.\"\nOFA's website says it obtained its \"digital\" assets from the ex-president's re-election effort and that he inspired the movement. In short, it is the shadow government organization aimed at resisting and tearing down the Constitutional Republic we know as AMERICA.\nPaul Sperry, writing for the New York Post, says, \u201cThe OFA will fight President Donald Trump at every turn of his presidency and the ex-president will command them from a bunker less than two miles from the White House.\"\nSperry writes that, \u201cThe ex-president is setting up a shadow government to sabotage the Trump administration through a network of non-profits led by OFA, which is growing its war chest (more than $40 million) and has some 250 offices nationwide. The OFA IRS filings, according to Sperry, indicate that the OFA has 32,525 (and growing) volunteers nationwide. The ex-president and his wife will oversee the operation from their home/ office in Washington DC.\nThink about how this works.. For example: Trump issues an immigration executive order; the OFA signals for protests and statements from pro-immigrant groups; the ACLU lawyers file lawsuits in jurisdictions where activist judges obstruct the laws; volunteers are called to protest at airports and Congressional town hall meetings; the leftist media springs to action in support of these activities; the twitter sphere lights up with social media; and violence follows. All of this happens from the ex-president's signal that he is heartened by the protests.\nIf Barack Obama did not do enough to destroy this country in the 8 years he was in office, it appears his future plans are to destroy the foundation on which this country has operated on for the last 241 years.\nIf this does not scare you, then we are in worse trouble than you know.\nSo, do your part. You have read it, so at least pass this on so others will know what we are up against. We are losing our country and we are so compliant. We are becoming a \"PERFECT TARGET\" for our enemy!\nCharles Krauthammer",

Except for country music, apparently drives them around the bend. They were recently interviewed and asked what concerts they would see after the crisis was over.\nThey both said the obvious. Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9. Maybe one of The Who\u2019s 427 farewell tours. When the interviewer, Joe Barron asked if they\u2019d take in a few country shows, seeing as how Mr. Barron is a huge country music fan, Barack Obama said: \u201cnot really a fan.\u201d\nMichelle Obama snorted and said, \u201cnot over my dead body.\u201d\nWhen the shocked interviewer asked why, she went into a long diatribe of how much she disliked the true American form of music, much of it shrouded in patriotic themes and Americana.\nShe said, \u201cthere\u2019s never been an art form so intellectually devoid, ever.\u201d\nI mean, who doesn\u2019t like country music?\nShe went on to state that maybe if she grew up in a trailer while dating her daddy\u2019s brother and was a lady trucker, maybe then could she stomach such untalented garbage. But since she didn\u2019t spit chewing tobacco and fly a rebel flag on her lifted pick up, there\u2019s no way she could ever be a fan of such junk.\nWow, just wow.\nCountry music is ingrained in American culture.  The simplistic rhythm with twangy vocals that are like nails on a chalkboard to get even the most unrefined people to tap their toes in their ripped socks and dirty denim jeans, the type of music you\u2019d have a relationship with your siblings to.\nHow dare Michelle Obama, or anyone else denigrate music for morons? And denigrate, for you country fans, means to make fun of.\nWhen asked about Barack\u2019s musical tastes, he responded with \u201cI love R&B, Motown, classic rock like Rush, and hip hop.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t share the vitriol about country music that Michelle did, but he certainly doesn\u2019t understand the appeal of such American hero music. After all, he did say he liked Rush, who are Canadian and not even American.",

Trump as President of the United States.\nIn a meeting with Breitbart News, the legendary American actor stated:\n\u201cI\u2019m completely sure that he is the best so far. I\u2019m saying I like this guy.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s an answer to our problems. We need to get behind him. The Republicans need to unite behind this man. We need somebody to go in and reconstruct us in a sort of way, get us back to where we were, who we need to be.\u201d\nThen he continued with something truly remarkable:\n\u201cDonald is funny, playful, and colorful, but most of all, he is honest. When he decided to run for president, I know he did it with a true conviction to bring this country back to prosperity. He is the only one who can do it. No frills, no fuss, only candid truths.\u201d\n\u201cI am very disappointed at the talk show hosts, also spewing out lies and propaganda against Donald. Why, I wonder? The only thing I can think of is he represents a form of freedom none of them ever saw before, and they are bewildered about it, and frightened about it. I would say \u201cf*ck you\u201d to all of them. To all that are criticizing him for no reason and want him to resign for no reason. Just go to hell all of you!\u201d\n\u201cI pray all Americans who have seen and felt the meltdown of America with the Obama years, to please fight for Donald Trump. He will not let us down. I pray for all good people to see clearly what faces us now. The right vote will save our nation.\u201d\nSelleck additionally noticed that Trump\u2019s capacity to keep up an inspirational demeanor despite the fact that \u201che has individuals assaulting him from each side\u201d was likewise a solid contention.This is outstanding people. This guy is a true legend. Thanks for this statement sir. Please SHARE this article with your friends to show this great praise of Tom Selleck.",

    "content": "The Irish slave trade began when 30,000 Irish prisoners were sold as slaves to the New World. The King James I Proclamation of 1625 required Irish political prisoners be sent overseas and sold to English settlers in the West Indies. By the mid 1600s, the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat. At that time, 70% of the total population of Montserrat were Irish slaves.\nIreland quickly became the biggest source of human livestock for English merchants. The majority of the early slaves to the New World were actually white.\nFrom 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and another 300,000 were sold as slaves. Ireland\u2019s population fell from about 1,500,000 to 600,000 in one single decade. Families were ripped apart as the British did not allow Irish dads to take their wives and children with them across the Atlantic. This led to a helpless population of homeless women and children. Britain\u2019s solution was to auction them off as well.\nDuring the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children between the ages of 10 and 14 were taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies, Virginia and New England. In this decade, 52,000 Irish (mostly women and children) were sold to Barbados and Virginia. Another 30,000 Irish men and women were also transported and sold to the highest bidder. In 1656, Cromwell ordered that 2000 Irish children be taken to Jamaica and sold as slaves to English settlers.\nMany people today will avoid calling the Irish slaves what they truly were: Slaves. They\u2019ll come up with terms like \u201cIndentured Servants\u201d to describe what occurred to the Irish. However, in most cases from the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish slaves were nothing more than human cattle.\nAs an example, the African slave trade was just beginning during this same period. It is well recorded that African slaves, not tainted with the stain of the hated Catholic theology and more expensive to purchase, were often treated far better than their Irish counterparts.\nAfrican slaves were very expensive during the late 1600s (50 Sterling). Irish slaves came cheap (no more than 5 Sterling). If a planter whipped or branded or beat an Irish slave to death, it was never a crime. A death was a monetary setback, but far cheaper than killing a more expensive African. The English masters quickly began breeding the Irish women for both their own personal pleasure and for greater profit. Children of slaves were themselves slaves, which increased the size of the master\u2019s free workforce. Even if an Irish woman somehow obtained her freedom, her kids would remain slaves of her master. Thus, Irish moms, even with this new found emancipation, would seldom abandon their kids and would remain in servitude.\nIn time, the English thought of a better way to use these women (in many cases, girls as young as 12) to increase their market share: The settlers began to breed Irish women and girls with African men to produce slaves with a distinct complexion. These new \u201cmulatto\u201d slaves brought a higher price than Irish livestock and, likewise, enabled the settlers to save money rather than purchase new African slaves. This practice of interbreeding Irish females with African men went on for several decades and was so widespread that, in 1681, legislation was passed \u201cforbidding the practice of mating Irish slave women to African slave men for the purpose of producing slaves for sale.\u201d In short, it was stopped only because it interfered with the profits of a large slave transport company.\nEngland continued to ship tens of thousands of Irish slaves for more than a century. Records state that, after the 1798 Irish Rebellion, thousands of Irish slaves were sold to both America and Australia. There were horrible abuses of both African and Irish captives. One British ship even dumped 1,302 slaves into the Atlantic Ocean so that the crew would have plenty of food to eat.\nThere is little question that the Irish experienced the horrors of slavery as much (if not more in the 17th Century) as the Africans did. There is, also, very little question that those brown, tanned faces you witness in your travels to the West Indies are very likely a combination of African and Irish ancestry. In 1839, Britain finally decided on its own to end its participation in Satan\u2019s highway to hell and stopped transporting slaves. While their decision did not stop pirates from doing what they desired, the new law slowly concluded THIS chapter of nightmarish Irish misery.\nBut, if anyone, black or white, believes that slavery was only an African experience, then they\u2019ve got it completely wrong.\nIrish slavery is a subject worth remembering, not erasing from our memories.",

In the last year this movement has grown exponentially.\n\u201cEverybody in power needs to wake up to what young people especially want.\u201d\nHowever, not everyone was in support. One motorist heckled the activists, shouting: \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time\u201d. But others on an open top bus passing the rally gave their thumbs up to the cheering activists,\nIt was the second annual march held - although this year\u2019s event started off slowly, the crowds swelled in the sunshine like last year when thousands of people joined. Those taking part want to put rejoining the EU back on the agenda.\nIt comes as The Independent reveals Keir Starmer held secret talks with Emmanuel Macron about Brexit. The Labour leader has said he will seek to improve the government\u2019s Brexit deal \u2013 but also insisted there is no case for rejoining the EU, its single market, or customs union.\nAs the march started, Madeleina Kay, 29, said the country had taken a \u201cdarker turn\u201d after the Brexit referendum in 2016.\nMs Kay, who was awarded Young European of the Year by the Schwarzkopf Foundation in 2018, said: \u201cI was very disappointed thought it was a different country. The only people I\u2019m angry at are the politicians because they lied to us.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve let everybody down and we can see the consequences of that now, the cost of living crisis they have taken rights away from us.\n\u201cRejoining is going to be a long campaign but the younger people voted Remain and that is the future.\u201d\nProud Welshman Gareth Kearns, 53, said: \u201cPeople always say only old people for Brexit is sort of true but when you get to the very elderly the people who actually remember the Second World War they are with us. But they can\u2019t be expected to go on a long march from here, they all take a shorter route.\u201d\nOn the march reaching Parliament Square, dancers waved EU flags while preparations were made for the speeches. German MEP Terry Reintke told those watching: \u201cWhen I see thousands of Europeans in the streets it makes me so hopeful that we will be back together again.\n\u201cThe EU is far from perfect we know this. We live in a cost of living crisis, we see war in Ukraine where geopolitical situation is really hard. Europeans are struggling. It\u2019s even more important for EU to stand together.",

Or, at the very least, \"Stand and Face It\". \nNOW GET THIS !! \n'Senator Obama replied:\n\"As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be perceived \nas taking sides\". \"There are a lot of people in the world to \nwhom the American flag is a symbol of oppression..\" \"The \nanthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the \nbombs bursting in air and all that sort of thing.\" \n(ARE YOU READY FOR THIS???) \nObama continued : \n\"The National Anthem should \nbe 'swapped' for something less parochial and less bellicose. \nI like the song 'I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing'. If that \nwere our anthem, then, I might salute it. In my opinion, we \nshould consider reinventing our National Anthem as well \nas 'redesign' our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and \nlove. It's my intention, if elected, to disarm America to the \nlevel of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren. If we, as a Nation of warring people, conduct ourselves like the nations \nof Islam, where peace prevails - - - perhaps a state or period \nof mutual accord could exist between our governments ....\"\nWhen I become President, I will seek a pact of agreement to \nend hostilities between those who have been at war or in a \nstate of enmity, and a freedom from disquieting oppressive \nthoughts. We as a Nation, have placed upon the nations of \nIslam, an unfair injustice which is WHY my wife disrespects \nthe Flag and she and I have attended several flag burning \nceremonies in the past\". \n\"Of course now, I have found myself about to become the \nPresident of the United States and I have put my hatred \naside. I will use my power to bring CHANGE to this Nation, and offer the people a new path.My wife and I look forward to becoming our Country's First black Family. \nIndeed,CHANGE is about to overwhelm the United States of \nAmerica \" \nYes, you read it right. \nI, for one, am speechless!!! \nDale Lindsborg , Washington Post\nEVERYONE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA NEEDS \nTO READ THIS, SO KEEP IT GOING ! ! \nSAVE AMERICA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE ! !",

    "content": "While most Americans sat glued to televisions and electronic devices on the evening of November 8, a blistering firefight between U.S. Marines devoted to restoring order to the Republic and federal agents loyal to the criminal Biden regime took place at the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington D.C., with the Marines suffering a crushing defeat, Real Raw News can now report.\nAlthough RRN takes no pleasure in highlighting White Hat losses, we have an obligation to report them, just as we do their triumphs.\nOn the morning of November 8, General David H. Berger greenlit an operation to seize control of the Federal Reserve after learning that the criminal Biden regime was in the process of buttressing the building\u2019s security with a 10\u2019 tall perimeter wall to prevent the outside world from discovering that the criminals within were minting billions and billions of dollars\u2014fiat currency unbacked by gold\u2014meant to reach the hands of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nSources in Gen. Berger\u2019s office told RRN that the general spoke to both President Trump and Trump\u2019s advisors before committing to the raid. The consensus, he added, was that the Fed would be dark and mostly empty due to it being Election Day, with only a small contingent of treasury agents guarding the 6-story, steel beam structure.\nGeneral Berger, sources added, handpicked two Marine Scout-Sniper platoons comprised of 24 men to fulfill the mission, the objectives of which included surveilling the building, eliminating or subduing opposition, and destroying the engraving & printing machines. The Marines arrived at the Fed at about 1:00 am an exploited a gap in the wall that was still under construction. While snipers provided overwatch, the other Marines stealthily approached the front doors\u2014then all hell broke loose.\nThe doors flung open, and treasury agents equipped with NVGs and armed with automatic rifles unleashed a phalanx of bullets at the Marines, striking and killing four Marines as they tried to rush the doors. The Marine snipers returned fire and downed three treasury agents, while the Marines in the courtyard dove for cover and fired into the doorway with their own M27 rifles. Three more Marines were struck down as they moved to flank the doors, and then IRS snipers appeared in the windows of the upper level, taking potshots in the general direction of the Marine sniper squads. One IRS sniper took a headshot and was felled, but the Marines quickly realized they were outmanned and outgunned as floodlamps illuminated the exterior and a voice echoed, \u201cYou\u2019ve walked into a trap and are covered from an elevated position. Drop your weapons and surrender. We have you outnumbered 20 to 1.\u201d\nThe Marines began a tactical retreat, laying down suppressive fire as they withdrew two-by-two through the gap in the wall from whence they came. The Marine snipers plunked at the windows and doorway while the men on the ground evaded a hailstorm of gunfire. Another Marine was wounded during the egress, and the remaining Marines escaped unharmed.\n\u201cThis was a loss,\u201d a source in Gen. Berger\u2019s office later told Real Raw News. \u201cThey obviously knew we were coming; we don\u2019t know how. That place is printing money hand over fist and sending it overseas. We meant to stop it. Matters are worse now, but we\u2019ll find a way.\u201d",

The secretary could tell in a moment that such backwoods, country hicks had no business at Harvard, and probably didn't even deserve to be in Cambridge.\n\"We'd like to see the president,\" the man said softly.\n\"He'll be busy all day,\" the secretary snapped.\n\"We'll wait,\" the lady replied.\n For hours the secretary ignored them, hoping that the couple would finally become discouraged and go away.   They didn't, and the secretary grew frustrated and finally decided to disturb the president, even though it was a chore she always regretted.\n\"Maybe if you see them for a few minutes, they'll leave,\" she said to him.\n He sighed in exasperation and nodded. Someone of his importance obviously didn't have the time to spend with them, and he detested gingham dresses and homespun suits cluttering up his outer office.\n The president, stern faced and with dignity, strutted toward the couple.\n The lady told him, \"We had a son who attended Harvard for one year. He loved Harvard. He was happy here.  But about a year ago, he was accidentally killed. My husband and I would like to erect a memorial to him, somewhere on campus.\"\n The president wasn't touched. He was shocked. \"Madam,\" he said, gruffly, \"we can't put up a statue for every person who attended Harvard and died. If we did, this place would look like a cemetery.\"\n \"Oh, no,\" the lady explained quickly. \"We don't want to erect a statue. We thought we would like to give a building to Harvard.\"\n The president rolled his eyes. He glanced at the gingham dress and homespun suit, then exclaimed, \"A building! Do you have any earthly idea how much a building costs?\n We have over seven and a half million dollars in the physical buildings here at Harvard.\"\n For a moment the lady was silent.\n The president was pleased.  Maybe he could get rid of them now.\n The lady turned to her husband and said quietly,\n \"Is that all it costs to start a university? Why don't we just start our own? \"  Her husband nodded.\n The president's face wilted in confusion and bewilderment.\n Mr. and Mrs. Leland Stanford got up and walked away, traveling to Palo Alto, California where they established the university that bears their name, Stanford University, a memorial to a son that Harvard no longer cared about.\n You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who they think can do nothing for them.\n-- A TRUE STORY By Malcolm Forbes",

That\u2019s a jump of more than 6,000 percent.\u201d\nDays later, the Public Utility Commission of Texas set prices at $9,000/MWh.\nIn a nutshell- what could have been avoided, wasn't, and millions of people have suffered because of the Biden administration refusing to allow more energy to be used in order to comply with their \"green energy\" agenda. \nSecondly, Texans have had their Electricity bills increase by HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS this past week, because the Biden administration forced ERCOT to increase its rates. \nThere's people here in Texas with $10,000 Electricity bills after this past week. \nThis entire crises was because of FAILED leadership, and Texans have paid the price for it with their lives, and their homes. \nThank a Democrat!",

    "content": "Trump to Abolish IRS\nWhen President Donald J. Trump makes an official return to office, he will sign an Executive Order abolishing an institution that has fleeced hard-working American citizens since its inception in 1862. That organization is, of course, the Internal Revenue Service. Archaic and dysfunctional, the IRS, which Donald Trump has called \u201cthe deepest depths of the Deep State,\u201d has defrauded working citizens of incalculable sums.\nSources at President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago headquarters told Real Raw News that Trump has long sought to eradicate the IRS, and he was in the midst of planning its dissolution when the Deep State stole the 2020 presidential election. Before that, though, Trump was not prepared to obliterate the IRS with a stroke of his presidential pen, because he and his closest advisors had yet to decide how vital entities like the U.S. military would survive sans federal tax dollars.\nOnly 20% of federal income tax funds national defense and security, and half of that funds frivolous alphabet agencies such as the unnecessary TSA, FEMA, and Plum Island Animal Disease Center, among others. The remainder has financed illegal immigration, illicit, covert wars on foreign soil, paid for legislatures\u2019 lavish vacations, and bankrolled vindictive federal trials against innocent persons. In fact, if you\u2019re a tax-paying patriot, your dollars (and mine) are funding the Biden regime\u2019s malicious prosecution of the 800 patriots who lawfully visited the Capitol\u2014the People\u2019s House\u2014on January 6.\nSources told RRN that Trump\u2019s team has found a viable way to finance the Armed Forces without collecting a single federal dollar. They would not prematurely share \u201cthe plan\u201d because doing so would give the Deep State time to publicly discredit it as part of their unsanctimonious war on Trump.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been years in design and he\u2019s not giving the Deep State a heads up,\u201d a source said. \u201cIt was always Trump\u2019s intent to drain the swamp. Unfortunately, he made mistakes early in his presidency by bringing the Deep State into his administration. The mistake won\u2019t happen twice. He\u2019s going to disembowel the federal government. The IRS is a primary head of the hydra; when it\u2019s severed, the other heads will die with it.\u201d\nThe Internal Revenue Service currently employs 78,661 people, each of whom earn ~$76,000 annually. In other words, taxpayers each year pay IRS employees $9bn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Trump\u2019s position we\u2019re paying them to rob us. Imagine if a home invader enters your house, and you say \u2018Oh, hi! Welcome. Let me pay you to rob me.\u2019 That\u2019s analogous of what\u2019s been going on for a very, very long time,\u201d a source said.\nCorruption within the IRS has run rampant, he added.\nIn early May 2022, it was revealed that IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig oversaw the destruction of data related to millions of filings. Rather than accept accountability, Rettig blamed data loss on \u201cCovid confusion.\u201d His \u201cerror\u201d delayed tax returns and, according to President Trump, was a carefully concocted plan to absolve high-earning Deep Staters of paying any federal taxes whatsoever.\n\u201cTens of thousands of Deep State millionaires and billionaires paid no taxes. Why did he demolish data on 30 million filings? Well, because the best way to commit a crime is to conceal it behind an accident. By fowling those 30 million filings, he was easily able to conceal ten thousand or so,\u201d our source said.\nTrump, he added, has seen enough.\n\u201cWith the destruction of the IRS, other agencies will wither and die. Trump wants Americans to reap the benefits of their hard work; he wants them to keep what they work for,\u201d he said.",

    "content": "After the Trump vs Biden debate John Cleese published this...\nBritain is Repossessing the U.S.A.\nA Message from John Cleese\nTo The citizens of the United States of America:\nIn light of your failure to nominate competent candidates for President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective immediately.\nHer Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths, and territories (except Arkansas, which she does not fancy).\nYour new prime minister, Boris Johnson, will appoint a governor for America without the need for further elections.\nCongress and the Senate will be disbanded.\nA questionnaire may be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.\nTo aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:\nYou should look up \"revocation\" in the Oxford English Dictionary.\n1. Then look up aluminium, and check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.\n2. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour.' Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters, and the suffix -ize will be replaced by the suffix -ise.\nGenerally, you will be expected to raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. (look up 'vocabulary').\n3. Using the same twenty-seven words interspersed with filler noises such as \"like\" and \"you know\" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.\nThere is no such thing as US English. We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell- checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u' and the elimination of -ize. You will relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen.\n4. July 4th will no longer be celebrated as a holiday.\n5. You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers, or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not adult enough to be independent.\nGuns should only be handled by adults. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist then you're not grown up enough to handle a gun.\n6. Therefore, you will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous than a vegetable peeler. A permit will be required if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.\n7. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and this is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean.\n8. All intersections will be replaced with roundabouts, and you will start driving on the left with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables.\nBoth roundabouts and metrification will help you understand the British sense of humour.\n9. The Former USA will adopt UK prices on petrol (which you have been calling gasoline)-roughly $10/US gallon. Get used to it.\n10. You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips, and those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called crisps. Real chips are thick cut, fried in animal fat, and dressed not with catsup but with vinegar.\n11. The cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all. Henceforth, only proper British Bitter will be referred to as beer, and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as Lager.\nSouth African beer is also acceptable as they are pound for pound the greatest sporting Nation on earth and it can only be due to the beer. They are also part of British Commonwealth - see what it did for them.\n12. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as good guys. Hollywood will also be required to cast English actors to play English characters.\nWatching Andie Macdowell attempt English dialogue in Four Weddings and a Funeral was an experience akin to having one's ears removed with a cheese grater.\n13. You will cease playing American football. There is only one kind of proper football; you call it soccer. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which has some similarities to American football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like a bunch of nancies). Don't try Rugby - the South Africans and Kiwis will thrash you, like they regularly thrash us. No more Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl, Cereal Bowl or Super Bowl. From now on..... get used to the World Cup.\n14. Further, you will stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the World Series for a game which is not played outside of America. Since only 2.1% of you are aware that there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. You will learn cricket, and we will let you face the South Africans first to take the sting out of their deliveries.\n15. You must tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us mad.\n16. An internal revenue agent (i.e. tax collector) from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all monies due (backdated to 1776).\n17. Daily Tea Time begins promptly at 4 pm with proper cups, never mugs, with high quality biscuits (cookies) and cakes; strawberries in season.\nGod save the Queen.\nJohn Cleese",

    "content": "MEL GIBSON'S SHOCK REVELATION ON HOLLYWOOD\nIn a shocking expos\u00e9, movie star Mel Gibson has blown the whistle on the epidemic of \u201cparasites\u201d who \u201ccontrol Hollywood\u201d that are involved in child sacrifice and pedophilia.\nThe Lethal Weapon star said that \u201cevery studio in Hollywood is bought and paid for with the blood of innocent children,\u201d adding that the \u201cmost valuable currency is the blood of babies. While in London, England promoting his latest role in Daddy\u2019s Home 2, Gibson described entertainment industry elites as an \u201cenemy to mankind\u201d who \u201cfeast on the blood of innocent children.\u201d\nHe said key players in the movie business \u201cget their kicks from destroying the sanctuary of children\u201d as they \u201cthrive on breaking every God-given taboo known to man.\u201d\n\u201cThey have a blatant disregard for the good of the people. Destroying people\u2019s lives is just a game to them \u2013 the more pain they can cause, the better the thrill. Children are just sustenance to them. They feast on the pain and fear, and the younger, the better.\u201d\n\u201cThese people follow their own religion and use it for moral guidance. It\u2019s not the sort of religious teachings you folks would ever hear about. They perform sacred rituals that are sick and totally at odds with the moral fabric that binds most patriotic Americans. The worst part: It\u2019s an open secret in Hollywood and everyone wants in on it.\u201d\nMel Gibson appeared on British prime-time BBC chatshow, The Graham Norton Show on Friday, where the veteran actor answered questions from shocked guests, in the green room backstage after his appearance, regarding the true nature of Hollywood \u201celites.\u201d\nHe explained how he had been blacklisted by Hollywood\u2019s controlling oligarchs in 2006 for voicing his opinions about the industry that clashed with their liberal agenda.\nHe said that since then he has been \u201cworking outside of the system\u201d which has given him a fresh perspective, saying:\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to comprehend, I know, and I\u2019m sorry that I am the one to break this to you, but Hollywood is an institutionalized pedophile ring. They use and abuse kids for their own sick \u2018spiritual beliefs,\u2019 if you can even call them that. I don\u2019t fully understand it myself, but they harvest these kids for their energy and feast on their blood. They don\u2019t do it mercifully either, they scare the sh*t out of them before they sacrifice them. The more innocent the child, the more terrified they are, the more they thrive on it,\u201d said the Braveheart star.\nWhat does that mean? They aren\u2019t doing this as some form of artistic expression, they are harvesting the blood of children and eating their flesh because they think it gives them some sort of \u2018life force.\u2019\n\u201cIf the child was mentally and physically suffering when they died, then it gives them \u2018extra life force. I don\u2019t understand why they do that, but that\u2019s what they do. Most of us have a moral compass that guides us through life, right? These people don\u2019t have that, or if they do, it\u2019s pointing in the opposite direction.\u201d\nGibson, who has spent the last 30 years working inside and outside of the Hollywood regime, says that the industry\u2019s hierarchy \u201cthrives on abuse, pain, torture, stress, and suffering.\nAccording to Gibson, the desire to inflict such abuse isn\u2019t limited to just the elite, but only \u201cthose at the top of the food chain can afford such a \u2018luxury,\u2019\u201d although, it\u2019s a \u201cgoal for most people in the industry.\u201d\n\u201cHollywood is drenched in innocent children\u2019s blood. The references to pedophilia and cannibalism have always been there, but for years they cryptic or symbolic. I was introduced to these practices in the early 2000s and was threatened with serious repercussions should I ever speak out. And, I don\u2019t just mean my career, I mean my life was threatened, my family\u2019s life would be in danger. I can only talk about it now as those people, those industry executives, they\u2019re all dead now.\u201d\n\u201cThey see the blood of a sexually abused infant as the \u2018ultimate prize\u2019 and say that it\u2019s \u2018highly enriched. Babies are like a \u2018premium currency\u2019 and hold a higher value of anything else you can think of: Diamonds, drugs, caviar, you name it. They are literally trading these kids like a currency for favors, movie roles, kickbacks\u2026\u201d\nAccording to Gibson, this perversion isn\u2019t just the latest fad but has been a deep-threaded culture in Hollywood for generations, and is something popular among both men and women.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t anything new and has been taking place since before Hollywood was even founded. If you research this phenomenon, you will find lurking in the shadows of every dark era in history. These dark, multidimensional occult practices have been used in secret societies for hundreds of years. Hollywood is being used for social programming and mind control and their message is being projected into the psyche of the American people\u2026People everywhere.\u201d",

    "content": "Liz Cheney Hanged at GITMO\nBy M. B. - April 27, 2023\nMonday, April 24\nStanding atop the gallows with a braided rope around her neck, Liz Cheney devoted her final breaths to excoriate President Donald J. Trump\u2014who was not present\u2014and his \u201cminions,\u201d accusing them of collectively subverting the Constitution to enforce a \u201cprivate brand of justice.\u201d Her eyes, open to narrow slits, like knife cuts, surveyed the officers who stood below and before her, as if memorizing faces for a future fight against them.\nAs is typical at hangings, a uniformed soldier tugged on the rope stretching from Cheney\u2019s neck to a beam several feet above them, testing for slack and tension. He nodded at Vice Admiral Crandall, signaling his readiness to push the button.\nA ruddy-cheeked Cheney rambled on about how Trump and Adm. Crandall would eventually face their own tribunals with a predetermined verdict of guilty. She said an ineluctable fate awaited them and their co-conspirators. She held Trump and the admiral responsible for her father\u2019s death and said her \u201cpeople\u201d would behead them.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all doomed,\u201d she said, shaking her shackled wrists, and she called Adm. Crandall an irritant, like a buzzing mosquito waiting to be squashed.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t personal; I take no enjoyment in my responsibilities,\u201d Vice Adm. Crandall said. \u201cYou took an oath to our country\u2014let me correct myself. It\u2019s not your country. It stopped being your country the moment you betrayed the Constitution. You\u2019re un-American. You, your people, you stand up there holding yourself blameless, no misgivings for what you\u2019ve done. I pity you; I really do.\u201d\nThe admiral seemed uncharacteristically patient. He gave Cheney more latitude than he had previous Deep Staters on the gallows. His face was devoid of expression, but he seemed genuinely interested in what made people like Cheney tick\u2014What drove them to value greed over charity? What compelling force stripped them of decency? His dispassionate look became one of puzzlement as he listened to Cheney\u2019s hateful monologue, her tongue flicking like a snake\u2019s as she cursed the admiral and his family.\n\u201cYou murdered my father. You killed my friends. And for that you will die,\u201d Cheney said.\nApparently the admiral had heard enough. He instructed the soldier on the platform to push the button, and a second later, Cheney was dangling in the wind. A Navy physician affirmed Cheney\u2019s death and noted the time: 9:30 a.m., Monday, April 24.\nAdm. Crandall had a busy schedule. He still had to oversee the hanging of two corrupt feds and then board one of several flights that would eventually carry him to Guam, where tribunals would be held for the foreseeable future.\n(Visited 15,135 times, 15,135 visits today)",

    "content": "Conservative Patriots\nJUST IN: Trump Authors Sealed Indictment on SCJ Amy Coney Barrett\nOn his last day in the White House, January 19, Donald J. Trump co-authored a flurry of sealed indictments, one of which charges Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett with high crimes and misdemeanors against America and its people, said a former USDOJ employee who helped Trump and then-acting AG Jeffrey Rosen research casework.\nOur source said Trump spent days pondering whether to formally charge the 49-year-old mother of seven, but concluded that Barret\u2019s betrayal to both him and the U.S Constitution could not go unpunished.\n\u201cTrump is a merciful man willing to accept almost anyone\u2019s apology, but he couldn\u2019t give her a free pass. Not after her ultimate betrayal,\u201d our source said.\nOn September 26, Trump triumphantly announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett in a ceremony at the White House Rose Garden before an audience of top Washington officials, other dignitaries, and family members. Barrett was seen as the conservative poster girl who would bring parity to the Supreme Court and stop the liberal left from hijacking the 2020 presidential election. For weeks, Trump championed her, showing her off at every possible opportunity.\nThe Senate confirmed her to the Supreme Court on October 26, and two days later she stabbed Trump in the back. On October 28, the Supreme Court ruled on Republican Party of Pennsylvania v. Kathy Boockvar, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, ruling in her favor. Boockvar wanted to extend the deadline for absentee ballots; the Republicans sought an injunction.\nThere is strength in unity and America is a great example of it to the countries across the world. In the need of the hour, each patriot has sacrificed their needs to help out a fellow citizen.\nHowever, hope can be lost in the darkest times, and the American people need something to unify them in such times of adversity. The fight is not over yet, says President Trump.",

We promised to take care of you in return for your service to this country. You promised us your life. Now it\u2019s time to help us protect you before we let you die some other way because you failed to avoid dying a way we didn\u2019t want you to. If this doesn\u2019t make sense to you, have a little faith. There is great honor in doing what you\u2019re told,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cYou are willing to fight and die for your country. You are willing to take a bullet in the head for next to nothing. Get blown to bits over in Afghanistan. But you won\u2019t let us pump some mRNA molecules into your arm?\u201d the president continued. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get real. Some of you are behaving like some real wise guys here, some real dummies. Wiseguy dumb-dumb boys, as my father used to say. Enough is enough. So sit down and get the dang shot. Do what we tell you to do and continue your service to this great country. Or go without your healthcare benefits. The choice is yours.\u201d @rr_tactical_cerakote",
